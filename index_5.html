	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Getting Subversion 1.7 integration working with Eclipse (3.7.1) and Subclipse 1.8 isn't all that straight-forward because Canonical currently only support the older Javahl-1.6 in their repositories. </p>

<p>If you don't want to switch repo's your best bet is to go with Subclipse 1.6 and the 1.6 version of javahl (and subversion) from the official Canonical Ubuntu repositories.</p>

<p>If you do want to go ahead with SVN 1.7, here's how I got it working by switching to repo's provided by dominik stadler:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add dominik's repository: <code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:dominik-stadler/subversion-1.7</code></li>
<li>Update apt: <code>sudo apt-get update</code></li>
<li>Install libsvn-java: <code>sudo apt-get install libsvn-java</code></li>
<li>Install subversion 1.7: <code>sudo apt-get install subversion</code></li>
</ol>

<p>To enable Eclipse to see your libsvn-java installation, go to the eclipse install directory (I install in <code>/home/steve/dev/tools/eclipse</code>) and edit the eclipse.ini file. </p>

<p>You need to add <code>-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni</code>, which is where libsvn-java's native libraries get installed. Add it immediately following <code>-vmargs</code>. My eclipse.ini file now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.2.0.v20110502.jar
--launcher.library
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.linux.x86_64_1.1.100.v20110505
-showsplash
org.eclipse.platform
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
-vmargs
-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni
-Xms40m
-Xmx600m
</code></pre>

<p>If you use Subclipse but never previously installed Javahl you probably see irritating warning dialogs the first time you do <em>anything</em> in Eclipse after a restart. Installing javahl correctly will prevent those :). </p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>If you've read my earlier post documenting my attempts to get Google to recognize my <a href="microformats_rich_snippets_rel_author_and_search_listings.html">rel=author</a> markup you'll see that I expended quite a bit of effort trying to get my mugshot to appear with search result listings for my blog pages. Here's what I'm aiming for:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DKGP9ZJF8G0/Ts7aVKcwJiI/AAAAAAAAHyE/ZHCauxKCvYM/s600/rich-snippets-search-listing.png" alt="rich-snippets test tool example of how search-result listings could look" /></p>

<p>Its been more than a month now, and the Googlebot has crawled my site many times, but still no mugshots. </p>

<p>Just lately I'm starting to think that there's absolutely nothing wrong with how I've marked up my content (this is confirmed by Google's rich-snippets testing tool as you can see in the screen-shot above). Rather I'm beginning to suspect a minor evil (or stupidity) is at play.</p>

<h3>rel=author: The small-print</h3>

<p>My suspicions were aroused on my latest re-reading of Google's documentation on rel=author. There are three things that struck me on this re-reading:</p>

<p>First, on the subject of your Google Profile picture, Google have this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"you'll need a Google Profile with a good, recognizable headshot as your profile photo"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mm, ok, well my profile pic is a headshot, and (I think) is pretty recognizable... but what, in Google's subjective judgement, is a "good" photo?</p>

<p>Second, and more ominously:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Google doesn't guarantee to show author information in Google Web Search or Google News results."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Riiiight. Here's the thing: when do Google actually show author information? Is it based on something algorithmic as you might expect from Google (e.g. PageRank), or is it a subjective human judgement?</p>

<p>Finally:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Once you're done, please complete this <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHdCLVRwcTlvOWFKQXhNbEgtbE10QVE6MQ">form</a> so we can let you know of any implementation issues. While we won't be able to individually reply to everyone who fills out this form, we may be in touch with questions about your data."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so this suggests that there actually may be a human in the loop, and google are actively white-listing sites for inclusion of author information. </p>

<p>I hope this is the case, because that would mean at least some small chance that my authorship info will <em>eventually</em> appear in search result listings.</p>

<h3>page-rank: The rich get richer</h3>

<p>Right now - perhaps somewhat pessimistically - I'm guessing that Google will show authorship information if you already have a sufficiently high page-rank (I've no idea what rank is required, but I'm pretty sure I'm a long way below it). </p>

<p>Here's why I think that:</p>

<ol>
<li>It would be very un-Google-like - not to mention unscalable - to have a human in the loop making subjective judgements.</li>
<li>Page-rank gives Google a heuristic on which to judge the quality of a site, and they (understandably) want to promote high-quality sites more vigourously.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Google: Evil, or just stupid?</h3>

<p>And here's why I think that is borderline evil, or at least stupid: it creates a situation where the already popular gain even more popularity, and the rest of us fade even further into obscurity. Its an example of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy algorithm</a> at work. </p>

<p>Come on Google - I'm following your rules to the letter, working hard to make the web a better place and helping you to better <a href="http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/">organise the world's information</a>, why aren't you taking advantage of that?</p>

<h3>Conclusion: It's all just speculation</h3>

<p>Actually my only real problem with all this is that it isn't clear how, when or why authorship information will or will not be used, which leads to the sort of speculation I've presented in this article. </p>

<p>If it were possible to understand definitively why my authorship information isn't showing I could potentially do something about it instead of spinning my wheels guessing how to make it work (and whining about it :)).</p>

</style>
Since I moved my blog from blogger I've noticed on many occasions that Chrome would screw up the text rendering on the first view of a page. Hit F5 to refresh and it goes away. For a long time I thought this was related to my use of web-fonts (the excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts#ChoosePlace:select">Google Web Fonts</a>, but in fact its simpler than that.</p>

<p>Eventually I took the time to look into it a bit more, and narrowed it down to the fact that I am using the <code>text-rendering:optimizeLegibility</code> css directive, which does make a nice difference to the kerning of the fixed-width fonts I'm using (<code>Ubuntu Mono</code>), but also has the apparent side-effect of setting negative margins on those fixed-width texts which make them run into/over surrounding text.</p>

<p>Once I'd figured out what was causing my problem a quick Google search showed I'm not alone. The chromium issue tracker has several relevant bug reports. I chose to add my tuppence to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=96936#c16">bug 96936</a></p>

<h3>Examples of the bug</h3>

<p>Here's what the problem looks like when <code>text-rendering:optimizeLegibility</code> is in use in Chrome 15 (and the as yet unreleased 16 beta):</p>

<p><img class="shadow" title="With 'text-rendering:optimizeLegibility'" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-T5peLzltfzU/TupN9gwMcoI/AAAAAAAAH18/_CDK0F-qh2Q/s600/text-rendering.png"></p>

<p>And here (and also now in the blog you are reading) is how it looks without optimizeLegibility:</p>

<p><img class="shadow" title="Without 'text-rendering:optimizeLegibility'" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sK4tre7Q8dc/TupN-4pchhI/AAAAAAAAH2E/7WYdEGb3kKk/s600/not-text-rendering.png"></p>

<p>If you are reading this in Google Chrome you can check to see if the bug still exists by taking a look at the example text below, which is taken from the sample I submitted to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=96936#c16">bug 96936</a>. If you see overlapping characters below, the bug is not fixed in your version of Chrome.</p>

<div class="example legible">
  <p>Code blocks inside paragraphs like <code>this</code> don't <code>look</code> very <code>nice</code> with text-rendering set to optimizeLegibility.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Note</em>: Some interesting characteristics of the bug include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Text renders correctly if you refresh the page after the initial visit</li>
<li>It appears much worse with certain fonts - fixed-width/monospace fonts in particular seem to suffer</li>
<li>The width of the text appears to be calculated incorrectly, not just margins - you can see this in the first screen-shot where the date tab cuts into the end of "2011".</li>
</ol>

Today while working on a project that uses <code>contenteditable &lt;div&gt;</code> elements I got stuck on a bug for a good long time because of the crazy failure-mode it exhibited. You can try for yourself in the <code>contenteditable</code> below (sooner or later I hope this bug will be fixed and the example will stop working :)).</p>

<div class="example">
  <div class="s1 s2" contenteditable="true">Try deleting the first character in this sentence (you won't be able to), or the last (the caret will disappear after deleting the character)</div>
</div>

<p>I'm working on a reasonably complex editor using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) with multiple content-editable <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements used to collect text input. You might be wondering why we're using <code>contenteditable</code> instead of <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> or something - well here's why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Styling <code>contenteditable</code>'s is much easier</li>
<li>Allowing the input area to grow to fit the contained content "just works" - this is pretty hard to do with a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, though it can be done.</li>
<li>We can deliberately insert html into the <code>contenteditable</code> as the user types - for example i'm creating a tag editor, and by using a <code>contenteditable</code> I can render the tags nicely even as the user is typing - say, whenever the user enters a delimiter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, <code>contenteditable</code>'s are not without problems - not least you have to deal with the html content that they produce (e.g. <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags produced by the enter key), and arbitrary html resulting from paste operations, but that's another story.</p>

<h2>How the bug manifests</h2>

<p>Anyways, I have a bunch of <code>contenteditable</code>'s in my web-app, all seemingly working fine. Then I notice that <em>one</em> of them is behaving a bit strangely: if I try to delete characters from the end of the content the <code>contenteditable</code> loses focus after deleting one character. </p>

<p>Being a complex app I have all kinds of event-handlers bound to these <code>contenteditable</code>'s, so I started removing the likely suspects one by one, trying to find the culprit.</p>

<p>Eventually I'd removed all the event-handlers and was scratching my head, wondering how on earth I could still have this problem on just one of my <code>contenteditable</code>'s. </p>

<p>I checked in Firefox - no problem, all working. I compiled the GWT app to pure javascript and ran outside of GWT development mode, just to be sure it wasn't some weird GWT-chrome-plugin bug - still suffering. I looked for other event handlers bound higher up the DOM tree. Still no joy.</p>

<h2>When the bug manifests</h2>

<p>Finally - almost in desperation - I started inspecting the CSS (surely the CSS could not be causing such bizarre behaviour, right? Uh, wrong!).</p>

<p>After some puzzling I reduced the replication steps down to some very simple html and an unfortunate collision of CSS styles:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;bug&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      .s1 { display:inline; }
      .s2 { display:table; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="s1 s2" contenteditable="true"&gt;delete me&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this CSS doesn't make sense - the two <code>display</code> settings conflict. That's easy to spot in a simple example like this, but much more difficult in a complex application with a large DOM tree and many many CSS styles. </p>

<p>As for the failure mode, you might expect one style to "win", and forgivably it could be a different style in different browsers. </p>

<p>What you really <em>don't</em> expect is the bizarre behaviour we experienced. The bug currently manifests in Chrome 15 (and 16 beta) on Linux, Mac and Windows(7), and is reported in the chromium issue tracker as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=107366">bug 107366</a>.</p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I recently registered a domain name for some static content i'm hosting in Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3). <a href="hosting_a_static_website_in_amazon_s3.html">Setting up an S3 bucket as a static website</a> is pretty straight-forward, but pointing your domain to it is tricky. After a bit of playing and googling I think I've got the right combination:</p>

<h4>Step-1: Create your S3 website bucket</h4>

<p>When naming your bucket you <em>must</em> use the same name as your domain - e.g. <code>www.mydomain.com</code>. The website end-point will then be something like <code>www.mydomain.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</code>. If you don't do this you will get warnings (404 not found, nosuchbucket).</p>

<h4>Step-2: Remove any existing "A" records</h4>

<p>Using the administration tools provided by your domain registrar, remove any <code>"A"</code> records that may have been automatically set up for your domain - you don't want your domain name pointing to "parking" sites.</p>

<h4>Step-3: Forward your root domain to www</h4>

<p>Forward your root domain (<code>mydomain.com</code>) to the <code>www</code> subdomain (<code>www.mydomain.com</code>). Most registrars and hosting companies give you the ability to forward domain names. With Fasthosts I had to "add" forwarding to my package, but it didn't cost anything extra.</p>

<p>If you can <em>mask</em> the forwarding, so much the better, as this will mean that visitors to your site will see your registered domain rather than the S3 url (depends what your registrar offers - fasthosts and godaddy both support masked forwarding). In Fasthosts admin, masking is a checkbox option in the forwarding configuration.</p>

<h4>Step-4: Add a `CNAME` pointing to your S3 site</h4>

<p>Add a CNAME for the <code>www</code> subdomain, pointing to your S3 website (<code>www.mydomain.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</code>). The admin tools should make this easy for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6aH7JLLgpVQ/TtFmqVjl4QI/AAAAAAAAH0k/vT_wK-8EEd0/s522/cname-config.png" alt="Add a CNAME" /></p>

<p>That's it - all you have to do now is wait for the changes to propagate (this can take a while).</p>

<h4>See it in action...</h4>

<p>You can see this in action with my setup:</p>

<p>My domain-name is overpayment-calculator.com, which forwards to <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com">www.overpayment-calculator.com</a>, which points (via CNAME) at my S3 bucket <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com">www.overpayment-calculator.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</a>, masking the S3 name (so that when you visit via the overpayment-calculator.com address you don't see the S3 address in the address bar).</p>

<p><em>p.s.</em> props to <a href="http://www.fasthosts.co.uk/">fasthosts</a> - the dns information propagated extremely quickly - from registering the domain name to acessing my site via that domain name (including the time it took me to do the set up) took less than one hour!</p>
