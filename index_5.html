	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>GWT JavaScriptObject's and JavaScript Overlays are very cool. I've written about them <a href="gwt_javascriptobjects_javascript_overlays.html">before</a>. It can get a bit tiresome to write jsni methods though, especially all those fiddly slashes, braces and asterisks at the end!</p>

<p>Here's a simple Eclipse code template that does the hard work for you, and lets you quickly tab-and-type through to completing your jsni method without ever having to type those fiddles again:</p>

<pre><code>public final native ${return_type} ${newName}()/*-{ 
    ${cursor} 
}-*/;
</code></pre>

<p>To add this in Eclipse:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the preferences dialog (Window -> Preferences)</li>
<li>Type "templates" into the filter box (it should have focus already so you can just start typing)</li>
<li>Select the bold entry under "Java -> Editor -> Templates"</li>
<li>In the right hand panel you'll see all the existing templates, and some buttons ... Click "New"</li>
<li>The "name" is also the shortcut for your new template, so enter "jsni"</li>
<li>Paste in the template text (copy from the code block above).</li>
<li>Click ok to return to prefs, and ok again to return to the editor and try it out ...</li>
</ol>

<p>To use your new template:</p>

<ol>
<li>Type "jsni" (without quotes) into a java editor and hit ctrl-space (or whatever your auto-complete shortcut is)</li>
<li>The first option in the auto-complete suggestions should be your "jsni" template - hit return to use it</li>
<li>Your template appears, and eclipse focuses the first part (the return type) for you to modify</li>
<li>Modify each part of the template in turn and press tab to move to the next part</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<p>Recent releases of the Google Eclipse plugin include some <a href="http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/gwt_jsni.html">nice jsni features</a> that you definitely don't want to miss out on - including code-completion and syntax highlighting.</p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>At the beginning of the year I worked with our Operations Manager in Beirut - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bassel-beaini/26/553/291">Bassel Beaini</a> - to do annual reviews for our whole development (and UX) team there. </p>

<p>As part of the review process we gave the developers an updated job specification, which I wanted to be both prescriptive and aspirational - the idea being to describe the role each should currently be playing, to make very clear what would be needed to move to the next level, and at the same time to make everyone want to up their game and take it to the next level.</p>

<p>The end result, I guess, is my attempt at a technology agnostic description of what makes a good developer. Being a developer myself I'm fairly biased towards the technical aspects of the role and probably tend to somewhat overlook the human side of things (team-work, interaction with other parts of the business incl. non-programmers, etc). I'd love to hear constructive feedback on how I could improve these descriptions for next year :)</p>

<p>Here are the "aspirational" parts of the job descriptions I wrote for the top-tiers - architect/expert and senior developer:</p>

<h2>Architect/Expert Developer</h2>

<p>A passionate technologist, you demonstrate excitement, deep interest and knowledge of all aspects of development: languages; paradigms; patterns; idioms; platforms; performance; reliability; scalability; quality; tools and technologies. You relish the challenge of hugely complex problems.</p>

<p>Possessing true mastery of at least one modern programming language and paradigm, along with advanced knowledge of idioms and Design Patterns and when (or when not) to apply them, you will be able to recognize opportunities to improve code at a glance, and have the confidence and competence to take these opportunities to refactor towards better design.</p>

<p>You must be able to explain at length the reasons behind (micro)architectural decisions you make - or help others to make - so that others may learn from you. Your code has a finesse and indescribable quality that is the envy of all who read and work with it. You have exceptional ability to narrow down potential sources of a problem, hone in on the root-cause, and propose a range of solutions and explain their pros and cons.</p>

<p>Your architectural skills allow you both to describe designs at a high level to the business, and also to hone in on the complexities and details that allow a design to be implemented successfully. You are able to interpret and translate abstract ideas from more business oriented colleagues and customers, and from those ideas produce designs and specifications for developers to implement. You will be able to identify and separate the real requirements from the incidental details that inevitably form part of such brain-storming or business driven interaction.</p>

<p>You will have excellent understanding and wider knowledge of development tools and processes, and be able to clearly explain, demonstrate, and teach their usage to others, especially those junior to yourself who may have no prior experience. You will be aware of facets of these tools and processes that are not in daily use, such that you will be able to turn these tools even more to your advantage in specific situations. You will be constantly looking for new ways to streamline your working practices and those of the team through use of new and existing tools and technologies.</p>

<p>As one of the most senior members of the development team you will set an excellent example of engineering discipline to your colleagues, and will be passionate about achieving the very best quality and helping those around you to do so. You will recognize and evangelize the benefits of engineering disciplines such as source-code control, unit-testing, and code-review, and have a very self-critical view of what constitutes "done".</p>

<p>You will delight in tackling a range of tasks, recognizing the pleasure to be found in a polished solution to the smallest problem, as well as the challenges of a more significant undertaking, and you will enjoy mentoring and engaging in discussion about all aspects of development with your colleagues.</p>

<h2>Senior Developer</h2>

<p>You are the kind of person who develops software for fun in your spare time - whether personal projects or open-source contributions. You are deeply interested in languages, paradigms, idioms, tools and technologies, and in solving difficult problems.</p>

<p>You take great pride in your work, and it shows clearly in the way your code speaks to others - simple, clean, thoroughly unit-tested and easily understood and maintained. You are able to recognize and fix many code-smells and can gently point them out to your less experienced colleagues during code-review. You are keen to develop your skills further through interaction with your colleagues - junior and senior - and by consistently executing any task, large or small, with the attitude that there is always something new to learn. You can quickly identify and fix problems from minimal descriptions.</p>

<p>You are accomplished at taking high level designs and specifications from Architects and implementing them successfully, including creating and assigning suitable sub-tasks to less advanced members of your team. You can articulately explain the reasons behind micro-architectural choices you make during implementation, and evaluate the pros and cons of such decisions.</p>

<p>You will have excellent understanding and wider knowledge of development tools and processes, and be able to clearly explain, demonstrate, and teach their usage to others, especially those junior to yourself who may have little or no prior experience. You will be so confident with and reliant upon these tools that you use them even for your personal projects, knowing that the benefits are well worth the extra up-front effort.</p>

<p>You will set an excellent example of engineering discipline to your peers and junior colleagues, and you understand and truly believe in the need for engineering discipline and processes in delivering high quality software. Your attitude toward any task is to produce the best solution you can and learn from the experience. You will actively seek feedback on your solutions from peers and senior colleagues, whether by code-review or less formal discussion.</p>

              <span class="meta" itemprop="datePublished"><time datetime="2011-10-12">October 12, 2011</time></span>
              <a itemprop="url" href="gwt_javascriptobjects_javascript_overlays.html"><h1 itemprop="name" itemprop="headline">GWT JavaScriptObjects (Javascript Overlays)</h1></a>
	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>GWT has a fantastic tool for "overlaying" java (GWT) classes on JSON objects such that you don't have to write any parsing code to parse a piece of JSON. There are some nice articles about this from the GWT folks themselves, for example <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay.html">this one</a>. The gist of it is, given some JSON like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "item": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "cheese",
    "type": "food"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>we can "overlay" a java class onto that JSON, and have the GWT compiler (and the browser's native JSON parsing) do the marshalling for us. </p>

<h2>JavaScript Overlay Types</h2>

<p>We do that by writing a JavaScript Overlay Type class that maps the native json data back to the the world of your Java code, and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Item extends JavaScriptObject
{
    protected Item(){}

    public final native Integer getId()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getName()/*-{ 
        return this.name; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getType()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>JSNI Methods</h2>

<p>Those three native methods are known in GWT-land as JSNI methods (JavaScript Native Interface), and the part in comments at the end is actually pure JavaScript that you can write to directly access parts of the JSON object. </p>

<p>In these native JSNI sections the "this" object being referred to is the JSON object itself, and although I've only shown very simple property access here you can in fact perform more complex operations if you like.</p>

<p>The return values from our JSNI can be Java's primitive wrappers or String, any class that extends JavaScriptObject (JSO), or one of a number of special JSO classes GWT provides such as JsArray, JsIterable, JsArrayString, etc.</p>

<p>I have exclusively used jsni methods in my example above, but you can include pure java methods as well (provided they are final) - say, for example, we need to parse a date from some json:</p>

<pre><code>public class Item extends JavaScriptObject
{
    private static final DateTimeFormat df = 
        DateTimeFormat.getFormat("yyyyMMdd");

    protected Item(){}

    public final Date whenCreated() {
        return df.parse(getCreateDateString());
    }

    public final native Integer getId()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getName()/*-{ 
        return this.name; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getType()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getCreateDateString()/*-{ 
        return this.createDate; 
    }-*/;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Mapping complex types</h2>

<p>These are simple examples of course, but i've had no trouble mapping even the most complex JSON objects using JSO's. You can map arrays easily enough using the built in GWT JsArray types, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Items extends JavaScriptObject
{
    protected Items(){}

    public final native JsArray getItems()/*-{ 
        return this.items; 
    }-*/;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would map the following JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{ items: [
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "cheese",
    "type": "food"
  },
  {
    "id": 456,
    "name": "ham",
    "type": "food"
  },
  {
    "id": 789,
    "name": "eggs",
    "type": "food"
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<h2>JavaScriptObject rules</h2>

<p>There are a couple of basic rules to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must have a protected no-arg constructor</li>
<li><em>All</em> methods must be "final"</li>
<li>Must not have any instance fields</li>
<li>May only implement a single Interface</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScriptObject "gotchas"</h2>

<p>With regard to that last point, there's another gotcha to look out for: only one JavaScriptObject class can implement any given interface. Think about that for a minute, because its more of a restriction than you might at first realise...</p>

<p>The whole point of Interfaces is to use them to define a contract that implementations will adhere to, so that multiple poly-morphically interchangeable implementations can be used. With JSO's, you can only have one single JSO implementation of an interface - for example you cannot have several JSO's which implement Iterable. This is for the same reason that all JSO methods must be final - JSO's cannot use dynamic method dispatch.</p>

<p>If you try to implement the same interface in more than one of your JSO's you don't (currently) get any warnings from the compiler ... instead you get crazy runtime behaviour due to the wrong JSO class's methods being invoked (because one of your JSO's will receive all method invocations for the interface, regardless of which class the method should have been invoked against).</p>

<p>Interestingly I ran into a problem in the latest GWT release (2.4) that reported a very unhelpful error message (I'm sure the messages in earlier releases of GWT were much more helpful actually). Here's the error message I got:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ClassFormatError: Illegal method name "$"
 in class com/xxx/xxx/client/model/UserResult
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(ClassLoader.java:631)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:615)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:465)
 at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.CompilingClassLoader.findClass
    (CompilingClassLoader.java:1085)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247)
</code></pre>

<p>... as it turns out, the problem actually was that I broke one of the rules - I had a non-final method in my JavaScriptObject. Not a very helpful error message in this case, which is fairly unusual in my experience of GWT.</p>
