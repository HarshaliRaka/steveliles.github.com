        <description><![CDATA[<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service - S3 - can be used to host a static web-site, but it isn't immediately obvious how to set this up. Here's how I did it (I'm using the standard AWS console for this):</p>

<h4>Step-1: If you haven't already, sign up for Amazon S3</h4>

<h4>Step-2: Log-in to the AWS console, and go to the S3 Tab</h4>

<h4>Step-3: Create an S3 bucket:</h4>

<p>It doesn't really matter what name you give your bucket unless you plan to <a href="pointing_a_domain_name_to_an_amazon_s3_bucket.html">forward a domain name to your S3 hosted site</a> </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ntmu1ROjx_k/TtEulvLq2qI/AAAAAAAAHy0/kAz8dljKeMU/s578/create-bucket.png" alt="Create a bucket" /></p>

<h4>Step-4: Upload your static site to the bucket</h4>

<p>Select your bucket in the "Buckets" pane, then right-click in the "Objects and Folders" pane and choose "upload". If you are uploading many folders you'll probably want to use the "enhanced" uploader applet.</p>

<h4>Step-5: Set your bucket to be a website:</h4>

<p>First, right-click on your bucket in the "Buckets" pane (far left) and choose "Properties".</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5qHHItMStOU/TtEumMeQGeI/AAAAAAAAHzA/3HSscD7aFr0/s426/bucket-properties.png" alt="Open Bucket Properties" /></p>

<p>The properties of your bucket will appear in the "Properties" pane at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4B_VhzIeRjw/TtEzQSqQdUI/AAAAAAAAHzY/EcMc-2ruk98/s600/bucket-properties-tabs.png" alt="Bucket Properties" /></p>

<p>In the bucket propertes go to the "Website" tab. Make sure to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the "enabled" box</li>
<li>Enter the name of an "index document" in the box (this will be page that should be loaded if someone visits the root of your bucket - websites typically us index.html).</li>
<li>Note the "endpoint" url - this will be the url to your website.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-poLROP8Apoc/TtE1Fn9kH2I/AAAAAAAAH0M/XQJ1XrGLoS8/s600/bucket-properties-website.png" alt="Bucket Properties Website Tab" /></p>

<p>If you open that in a separate tab in your browser now you will see permission denied errors, so lets fix that...</p>

<h4>Step-6: Make your web-site accessable to viewers:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Still in the bucket "Properties" pane, open the "Permissions" tab and click "Edit Bucket Policy" - a window pops up.</li>
<li>Paste in the code from the box below, replacing <code>mybucketname</code> with, well, your bucket name :)</li>
<li>Click <code>save</code> and your done - go visit that end-point url which should now be hosting your static website :)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the permissions policy you need - don't forget to change <code>mybucketname</code>!</p>

<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "PublicReadForGetBucketObjects",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
        },
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucketname/*"
    }]
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Step-7: Registered a domain-name? Point it at your S3 hosted website...</h4>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/plus_one_any_page_google_1_bookmarklet.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Many pages that you might want to share don't have <code>Google+</code> <img src="images/gplus.png" alt="plus button" /> buttons. This bookmarklet makes it easy to plus-one any page directly while browsing it.</p>

<p>To install the bookmarklet just drag the <code>Google+1</code> link below to your browser bookmarks bar:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;font-size:75px; font-family:'Ubuntu Mono',monospace;"><a href="javascript:var gpc=document.createElement('div');gpc.style.position='fixed';gpc.style.top='50px';gpc.style.right='50px';gpc.style.padding='50px';gpc.style.backgroundColor='#def';var gp=document.createElement('g:plusone');document.body.insertBefore(gpc,document.body.firstChild);gpc.appendChild(gp);window.___gcfg={lang:'en-GB'};(function(){var po=document.createElement('script');po.type='text/javascript';po.async=true;po.src='https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js';var s=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(po,s);})();">Google+1</a></div>

<p>To use the bookmarklet at any time while browsing the web just click the link on your bookmarks bar and a +1 button will appear in the top-right corner of the page. Click the plus one button to share and comment just like you would on any other site that already has +1 buttons (feel free to test it out on this page!).</p>

<p>I have tested this bookmarklet in Chrome 16.0.9 and Firefox 8.0. Please leave a comment if you have trouble with other browsers and I'll see what I can do.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 6 users might struggle - the bookmarklet code is longer than IE6 can cope with. May I suggest upgrading to one of the many much better browsers available, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. </p>

<p>Alternatively you can try this bookmarklet (disclaimer: I cannot test it - I don't have IE6) - drag the "Google+1" to your browser links bar:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;margin:auto;font-size:75px; font-family:'Ubuntu Mono',monospace;"><a href="javascript:var gpc=document.createElement('div');gpc.style.position='fixed';gpc.style.top='50px';gpc.style.right='50px';var gp=document.createElement('g:plusone');document.body.insertBefore(gpc,document.body.firstChild);gpc.appendChild(gp);window.___gcfg={lang:'en-GB'};(function(){var po=document.createElement('script');po.type='text/javascript';po.async=true;po.src='https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js';var s=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(po,s);})();">Google+1</a>(IE6)</div>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently registered a domain name for some static content i'm hosting in Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3). <a href="hosting_a_static_website_in_amazon_s3.html">Setting up an S3 bucket as a static website</a> is pretty straight-forward, but pointing your domain to it is tricky. After a bit of playing and googling I think I've got the right combination:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create your S3 website bucket with the same name as your domain - e.g. <code>www.mydomain.com</code> (The website end-point will then be something like <code>www.mydomain.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</code>)</li>
<li>Remove any <code>A</code> records your registrar may have automatically set up.</li>
<li>Forward your root domain (<code>mydomain.com</code>) to the <code>www</code> subdomain (<code>www.mydomain.com</code>). If you can <em>mask</em> the forwarding, so much the better (depends what your registrar offers - fasthosts and godaddy both support masked forwarding).</li>
<li>Add a <code>CNAME</code> for the <code>www</code> subdomain, pointing to your S3 website (<code>www.mydomain.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</code>).</li>
<li>Wait for the changes to propagate (this can take a while).</li>
</ol>

<p>My domain-name is overpayment-calculator.com, and <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com">www.overpayment-calculator.com</a> points at my S3 bucket <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com">www.overpayment-calculator.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</a>, masking the S3 name (so that when you visit via the overpayment-calculator.com address you don't see the S3 address in the address bar).</p>

<p><em>p.s.</em> props to <a href="http://www.fasthosts.co.uk/">fasthosts</a> - from registering the domain name to my amazon static site appearing at that domain name (including the time it took me to do the set up) took less than one hour!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Whilst moving my blog from Blogger to github pages I've been looking into various ways to bump up my traffic. </p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> microformats some time ago and read about plans from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to support them. I implemented the <a href="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">BlogPosting</a> microformat to mark up my posts "semantically", and waited to see what google would make of it.</p>

<p>I admit, I was pretty excited at the thought of my search listings being presented in a more interesting fashion - I think that would really make them stand out. Here's an example of what Google's "rich snippets" testing tool makes of my articles:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-svXxV_v3GEM/Ts7iHUCNneI/AAAAAAAAHyY/lpTiC3ZKFI0/s867/rich-snippets.png" alt="rich snippets info for one of my blog posts" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately to-date it hasn't made a great deal of difference to how my posts are presented in a google search result.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-56_YwrdGwv4/Ts7VbPtTwHI/AAAAAAAAHw8/s__A_feIMnY/s600/search-listing.png" alt="google search listing" /></p>

<p>The first result in that listing image is for my blog. The only difference I see is that my blog result shows a date (which is nice, but I'm not sure its there because of the rich snippets markup - my old blogger blog shows dates like this too, and currently has no metadata markup that I can spot in the html source).</p>

<p>So much for rich snippets. </p>

<p>More recently I came across <code>rel=author</code>, and again I've been quite excited to try it out. This time I checked before-hand and found a handful of webby types who've got this working on their blogs. Here's what they look like:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-j1PTvhmppyU/Ts7XnanwE-I/AAAAAAAAHxs/N4Z7toDlRN0/s600/rel-author-search-listing.png" alt="google search listing with rel=author" /></p>

<p>A couple of weeks later I'm still having a bit of a trial getting this to work. I've done the setup exactly as described by google and a bunch of these other guys who've got it working - no joy. I'm using the three-way setup as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>From each blog post, link to my about page with rel="author" (I've linked the lego man image at top-right in the header).</li>
<li>From my about page, link to my google profile with rel="me" (I have two links, one <code>&lt;link rel="me"&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and one in an <code>&lt;a rel="me" ..</code> in the G+ icon in the navigation bar just below the header.</li>
<li>From my google profile, create a contributes-to link back to my about page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for this set of reciprocal links is so that google can trust that the content really is produced by you, and its no hard-ship to set up. Except that for some reason I can't fathom it just <em>doesn't work for me</em>.</p>

<p>The rich-snippets testing tool gives me the all-clear, and even shows an example search listing:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DKGP9ZJF8G0/Ts7aVKcwJiI/AAAAAAAAHyE/ZHCauxKCvYM/s600/rich-snippets-search-listing.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I've tried about a dozen variants now, each time waiting for a re-index before trying something different (you can tell when you've been indexed using Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Webmaster Tools</a>).</p>

<p>So far I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relative links between blog-post and about page</li>
<li>Absolute links between blog-post and about page</li>
<li>All links as <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
<li>All links as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements in the page <code>&lt;body&gt;</code></li>
<li>All combinations of the above alternatives</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a few remaining alternatives in the works. One is to remove all rel=me links to profiles other than google (I currently also have twitter and linked-in profiles linked with rel=me). </p>

<p>Another is to add a link to my google+ profile in an <code>&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/105248011271585565954?rel=author"&gt;Steve+&lt;/a&gt;</code> (yes, with the + at the end of the link text - see <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=1408986">option 2, here</a>). </p>

<p>There's also <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHdCLVRwcTlvOWFKQXhNbEgtbE10QVE6MQ">this form</a> which sounds tantalisingly like it might be a necessary part of the process, and which I hadn't previously seen mentioned anywhere. I've submitted the form, but a bit of googling suggests that it will make no difference.</p>

        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/a_multi_class_union_css_selector.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/a_multi_class_union_css_selector.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p><style>
  .example { 
    margin:25px;
    padding:20px;
    border:1px dotted #aaccbb; 
    background-color:#eeffdd;
  }
  .urgent { color:red; }
  .important { font-weight:bold; }
  .urgent.important { font-style:italic; }
</style>
Several times while working on the styling of this blog I've wanted to style elements differently when the complete combination or set union of css classes are used on the same element. If the css classes are applied separately the style should not apply. Until today I didn't realise that this is, in fact, both possible and easy to achieve.</p>

<p>Here's the html I want to be able to write:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="urgent"&gt;something urgent&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="important"&gt;something important&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="urgent important"&gt;urgent &amp; important&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how that should look:</p>

<div class="example">
  <div class="urgent">something urgent</div>
  <div class="important">something important</div>
  <div class="urgent important">urgent & important</div>
</div>

<p>The urgent &amp; important text should be bold, red and italic in your browser (and if it isn't you must have stumbled on this page by accident while trying to use the interweb to find funny cat pictures on your circa 2003 PC. No cat pictures here, <a href="http://images.lmgtfy.com/?q=funny+cat+pictures">move along</a>).</p>

<p>Here are three ways you can achieve the effect. Make sure you get to option-3, even if you have to skip options 1 and 2 (hint: they both suck).</p>

<h3>Option 1: specific, separate css class</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  .urgent { color:red; }
  .important { font-weight:bold; }
  .both   { font-style:italic; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class="urgent"&gt;Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="important"&gt;Bold Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="urgent important both"&gt;Bold Italic Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is nasty. I want to define my css classes to be as orthogonal and meaningful as possible, and while creating my html markup I do not want to be "mixing concerns" that should be kept separate.</p>

<h3>Option 2: nested html tags and ancestry selectors</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  .urgent { color:red; }
  .important { font-weight:bold; }
  .urgent .important { font-style:italic }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class="urgent"&gt;Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="important"&gt;Bold Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="urgent"&gt;
  &lt;div class="important"&gt;Bold Italic Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Double nasty, take it away! Now I've had to change my html markup to nest <code>.important</code> under <code>.urgent</code>, just so I can style things as I want them. It also doesn't work if I nest them the other way around. This is really stupid and annoying: styling should be separate from markup.</p>

<p>OK, so here's the right way to do it, and I just can't believe it took me so long to feel the pain hard enough to go looking for a solution...</p>

<h3>Option 3: use the union selector</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  .urgent { color:red; }
  .important { font-weight:bold; }
  .urgent.important { font-style:italic; }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class="urgent"&gt;Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="important"&gt;Bold Text&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="urgent important"&gt;Bold Italic Red Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The difference in the css declaration between option-2 and option-3 is so small I'll point it out, just in case you missed it: </p>

<ul>
<li>the union selector uses <em>both</em> class names <em>without</em> the space separating them - like this <code>.urgent.important</code>.</li>
<li>whereas the example in option-2 <code>.urgent .important</code> separates the two classes with a space, and matches on an element with <code>.important</code> descending from an element with <code>.urgent</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>CSS can be a thumping great pain, but just occasionally it comes up trumps.</p>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/weighted_average_smoothing_with_java2d.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Since my <a href="">original post</a> I've done a little bit more playing with processing images to try to give them a "vectorised" look. I really didn't change much, just played with the algorithm for choosing pixel colour. The algorithms all work by examining the colours of the current and surrounding pixels to determine what colour to paint the current pixel. The colour selection is performed by classes that implement the following simple interface:   </p>

<pre><code>interface Counter {
    // add a colour channel value for one of 
    // the neighbouring pixels
    public void add(int aValue);

    // calculates the value we should use
    // for the current colour channel of the
    // current pixel based on its neighbours
    public int mostFrequent();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The client code that deals this interface invokes the add method 3 times for each pixel - once for each colour channel (red / green /blue). The client code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>// calculate the colour 
private int count(int anOffset, int[] aSurrounding) {
    Counter _c = getCounter();
    int _length = aSurrounding.length-(2-anOffset);
    for (int i=anOffset; i&amp;lt;_length; i+=3) {
        _c.add(aSurrounding[i]);
    }
    return _c.mostFrequent();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see that I can easily supply different implementations of Counter, so I can try different algorithms easily.</p>

<h3>The original colour-selection algorithm</h3>

<p>The original algorithm simply takes the most frequent value of each colour channel so that, for example, if 51% of the surrounding pixels are bright blue, and the other 49% are bright red, this pixel will be bright red.</p>

<pre><code>class SimpleCounter implements Counter {
    int[] values = new int[256];

    public SimpleCounter() {
        Arrays.fill(values, -1);
    }

    public void add(int aValue) {
        values[aValue] += 1;
    }

    public int mostFrequent() {
        int _highest = -1;
        int _colour = -1;
        for (int i=0; i&amp;lt;256; i++) {
            if (values[i] &amp;gt; _highest) {
            _highest = values[i];
            _colour = i;
            }
        }
        return _colour;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This algorithm does produce the effect I'm looking for, but I get some sharp edges and colour bleeding that I don't really want (see example output below).</p>

<h3>The weighted-average algorithm</h3>

<p>This algorithm weights the values of the surrounding pixels relative to the most common value, so we get a weighted average that does take some account of less popular colours in the neighbourhood of the current pixel.</p>

<p>The result of the weighted average algorithm is a much smoother colour composition with a reduction in the aliasing effects that can be seen in the more simple algorithm's output. It does have a significant performance penalty however - on my quad core i7 laptop on an image of 600x650 pixels and a 16x16 neighbourhood, the simple algorithm completes in 10 seconds, whereas the weighted-average needs 90 seconds!</p>

<h3>Output for comparison</h3>

<p>Here are some examples for comparison. First is the original image, then then the image processed with the simple colour selection algorithm, followed by the weighted average algorithm.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back I was talking with someone who was looking into over-paying a loan. The premise is that, provided your lender allows overpayments, by over-paying you can save a fortune in interest payments.</p>

<p>The amount you can save isn't all that straight-forward to work out, due to the miracle that is compound interest. I knocked up a quick <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com/">overpayment calculator</a> using <code>gwt.progressive</code>, which I'm <a href="hosting_a_static_website_in_amazon_s3.html">hosting at Amazon S3</a> with a <a href="pointing_a_domain_name_to_an_amazon_s3_bucket.html">registered domain name</a>.</p>

<p>Here's one of the classes that's being bound - or "activated" if you like - by gwt.progressive:</p>

<pre><code>public class OverpaymentSummary extends Composite {
    interface MyActivator extends WidgetActivator&amp;lt;OverpaymentSummary&gt;{}
    MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyActivator.class);

    @RuntimeUiWidget(id="saving") InlineLabel saving;
    @RuntimeUiWidget(id="years") InlineLabel years;
    @RuntimeUiWidget(id="months") InlineLabel months;

    public OverpaymentSummary(Element anElement) {
        initWidget(activator.activate(this, anElement));
    }

    public void setResults(
        Money aStandardTotal, int aStandardMonths, 
        Money anOverpaidTotal, int anOverMonths) {
        saving.setText(aStandardTotal.minus(anOverpaidTotal).toString());

        int _monthsSaved = aStandardMonths - anOverMonths;
        setYears(_monthsSaved/12);
        setMonths(_monthsSaved - ((_monthsSaved/12)*12));

        removeStyleName("hidden");
    }

    private void setYears(int aYears) {
        years.setText(""+aYears);
    }

    private void setMonths(int aMonths) {
        months.setText(""+aMonths);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is bound onto html that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;div class="summary hidden"&gt;By overpaying you could save
&amp;lt;span id="saving"&gt;???&amp;lt;/span&gt;, and reduce your mortgage 
term by &amp;lt;span id="years"&gt;?&amp;lt;/span&gt; years and 
&amp;lt;span id="months"&gt;?&amp;lt;/span&gt; months!&amp;lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>&amp;lt;span&gt;</code> elements with the id's "saving", "years", and "months" - these are bound automatically to the three <code>InlineLabel</code>'s annotated with <code>@RuntimeUiWidget</code>.</p>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/creating_a_vectorisation_effect_with_java2d.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>On my <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/about_me.html">about me</a> page I have a picture of myself wearing a stupid hat and an even more stupid grin. This picture started out as an old photograph from which I removed the background using GIMP, then vectorized using an online tool called <a href="http://vectormagic.com/home">Vector Magic</a>.</p>

<p>Vector Magic is a very cool tool - it converts bitmap's to vector images by "tracing" the bitmap. Once vectorised you can rescale the image as large as you like without losing the smooth edges.</p>

<p>Here are the two images of me - on the left is the bitmap (before vectorisation) and on the right is a bitmap of the vectorized image created by Vector Magic (I vectorised the image for the comic-book <em>effect</em> of vectorisation, not in order to use the vector image itself):</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TW1qOjU0mxY/TsQyq8NZ8mI/AAAAAAAAHpw/o2s_M3fUDNk/s291/before.png"></td>
    <td><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-okVBiU07UVo/TsQyq2py0HI/AAAAAAAAHps/Wk7l-acfBxY/s281/after.png""></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Hopefully you can see the effect I'm talking about - large areas of colour are blocked out, and generally you get a kind of comic-book or oil-painting effect.</p>

<p>After vectorizing that image I started wondering how it worked and if I could whip up something myself, and so I began playing with Java2D to see if I could get close.</p>

<h2>"Hatching" the image</h2>

<p>I began my efforts with a very simple approach of testing pixels in each row and "dragging" a pixel colour across adjacent pixels until I encounter a pixel with a significantly different colour, at which point I swap the current colour and repeat the process.</p>

<p>Thanks to Java2D doing all the heavy lifting, the code is pretty short:</p>

<pre><code>public void hatch() {
    // load the image and extract the raster data
    BufferedImage _img = loadImage("cat.jpg");
    Raster _raster = _img.getData();

    // prepare a new raster to write the hatched
    // version of the image to
    BufferedImage _copy = new BufferedImage(
        _img.getWidth(), _img.getHeight(), _img.getType());
    WritableRaster _writable = _copy.getRaster();

    double[] _current = new double[3];
    double[] _previous = new double[3];
    double[] _write = new double[3];

    int _threshold = 75;

    for (int y=0; y&amp;lt;_img.getHeight(); y++) {
        for (int x=0; x&amp;lt;_img.getWidth(); x++) {
            // for each pixel in the image, decide whether
            // to use its original colour, or to drag in the
            // colour of a preceding pixel
            _current = _raster.getPixel(x, y, _current);
            _write = decide(_previous, _current, _threshold);
            _writable.setPixel(x, y, _write);
            _previous = Arrays.copyOf(_write, _write.length);
        }
    }

    // save the result to a new png file
    ImageIO.write(_copy, "png", new File("cross-hatch.png"));
}

private double[] decide(double[] aThis, double[] aThat, int aThreshold) {
    for (int i=0; i&amp;lt;aThis.length; i++) {
        if (Math.abs(aThis[i] - aThat[i]) &amp;gt; aThreshold) {
            return aThat;
        }
    }
    return aThis;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This has an interesting arty effect of "hatching" the image, but before the vectorisation effect becomes significant I start to get colour runs, where the colour gets dragged too far. </p>

<p>I played around with combining vertical and horizontal (and even diagonal) hatching with lower thresholds, which again produces a nice arty effect - particularly on hi-res images, but it isn't really the effect i'm looking for.</p>

<p>Below are some (lo-res) examples, using a high threshold value to make the effect more pronounced.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WaE9HVjyP00/TsQ5Mnf749I/AAAAAAAAHqY/QhN9JEmDW8o/s290/cat.jpg"><div class="caption">original image</div></th>
    <th><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TMtXRSp3G68/TsQ5QdqoajI/AAAAAAAAHqg/7axdHs9O34I/s290/vertical.png"><div class="caption">vertical hatching</div></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iwdfREXJWx8/TsQ5o1FhKXI/AAAAAAAAHqo/MsgbftSuYs4/s290/horizontal.png"><div class="caption">horizontal hatching</div></th>
    <th><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nsB6SodNjCg/TsQ6A0HMeJI/AAAAAAAAHq8/KPhxcJyPEQ4/s290/cross-hatch.png"><div class="caption">cross hatching</div></th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If you look carefully at certain areas of the images you can see the colour runs - for example on the dark area just where the cats leg joins its body at bottom right of the image, you can see the lighter brown vertical lines in the vertical-hatching image, and similar horizontal lines in the horizontal hatching image.</p>

<p>Notice that the cross-hatching image is starting to get the blocky effect somewhat similar to vectorisation, but pushing the thresholds high enough to create significant blocks of colour ruins the overall effect by dragging too much colour across the image.</p>

<p>I tried various techniques to reduce the drag effect - including an inverse-square factor of the distance since the colour was first encountered. This did indeed smooth things quite a bit, but still doesn't achieve the effect i'm looking for. Time for a new approach.</p>

<h2>Edge Detection</h2>

<p>Next I pondered some obvious techniques like edge detection. The classic mechanism for edge detection is to apply a filter, or convolution kernel, where each pixel is treated with respect to several surrounding pixels. Simple edge detection kernels look something like this:</p>

<table style="width:auto; margin:auto;">
  <tr>
    <th>
      <table style="width:90px; border:1px solid black; margin:20px;">
        <tr>
      <th class="caption">-1</th>
      <th class="caption">0</th>
      <th class="caption">1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="caption">-2</th>
      <th class="caption">0</th>
      <th class="caption">2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="caption">1</th>
      <th class="caption">0</th>
      <th class="caption">1</th>
    </tr>
      </table>
      <div class="caption">Horizontal</div>
    </th>
    <th>
      <table style="width:90px; border:1px solid black; margin:20px;">
        <tr>
      <th class="caption">-1</th>
      <th class="caption">-2</th>
      <th class="caption">-1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="caption">0</th>
      <th class="caption">0</th>
      <th class="caption">0</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="caption">1</th>
      <th class="caption">2</th>
      <th class="caption">1</th>
    </tr>
      </table>
      <div class="caption">Vertical</div>
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Here's what running the "horizontal" edge-detection kernel on the cat image produces:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ISL5K81GcKQ/TsRF_VK5KYI/AAAAAAAAHrY/xov4o7PQkMQ/s290/horiz-edge.png">
      <div class="caption">Edge Detected</div>
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And the code for that, again made very simple by Java2D's built in convolution support:</p>

<pre><code>public void edgeDetect() throws Exception {
    BufferedImage _input = loadImage("cat.jpg");
    BufferedImage _horiz = convolve(_input, newHorizontalKernel());
    ImageIO.write(_horiz, "png", new File("edge.png"));
}

private BufferedImage convolve(BufferedImage anImage, Kernel aKernel) {
    BufferedImage _out = new BufferedImage(
        anImage.getWidth(), anImage.getHeight(), anImage.getType());

    ConvolveOp _op = new ConvolveOp(aKernel, ConvolveOp.EDGE_NO_OP, null);
    _op.filter(anImage, _out);

    return _out;
}

private Kernel newHorizontalKernel() {
    return new Kernel(3, 3, new float[] {
        -2, -4, -2,
        0, 0, 0,
        2, 4, 2
    });
}

private Kernel newVerticalKernel() {
    return new Kernel(3, 3, new float[] {
        -2, 0, 2,
        -4, 0, 4,
        -2, 0, 2
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a neat result, and probably I could use the edges thus detected as indicators of where to switch colours, but this just seems like a very round-about way of producing what i want. Time for a new approach.</p>

<h2>Convolution with a dynamic kernel</h2>

<p>After scratching my head for a while I figured that what I really want to do is somewhere between the two approaches outlined above. I want to use a weighted function of the surrounding pixels (like a convolution kernel), but I want to do something a bit more complex than I can achieve with a static convolution kernel.</p>

<p>After quite a bit more monkeying around I finally nailed it. This time I'm examining pixels around the current one, finding the most common value for each colour channel, and giving the current pixel the most common value for each colour channel. Strictly speaking this isn't a convolution operation at all, but the analogy is a useful one.</p>

<p>I get some slightly funky alias effects on some images, so my next task is to smooth that out, but overall the results are very close to what I was after.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>public void vectorEffect()
throws Exception
{
    BufferedImage _img = loadImage("cat.jpg");
    Raster _raster = _img.getData();

    BufferedImage _copy = new BufferedImage(
        _img.getWidth(), _img.getHeight(), _img.getType());
    WritableRaster _writable = _copy.getRaster();

    int _blockWidth = 8;
    int _blockHeight = 8;

    int _halfWidth = _blockWidth / 2;
    int _halfHeight = _blockWidth / 2;

    int[] _lens = new int[(_blockWidth * _blockHeight) * 3];

    for (int y=0; y&amp;lt;_img.getHeight(); y++) {
        for (int x=0; x&amp;lt;_img.getWidth(); x++) {
            // get the surround NxM pixel grid as a
            // one dimensional array of r,g,b values
            _lens = _raster.getPixels(
                Math.max(0, x-_halfWidth), 
                Math.max(0, y-_halfHeight), 
                Math.min(_img.getWidth()-x, _blockWidth), 
                Math.min(_img.getHeight()-y, _blockHeight), 
                _lens
            );
            _writable.setPixel(x, y, getPixelColour(_lens));
        }
    }

    ImageIO.write(_copy, "png", new File("vector-effect.png"));
}

// choose the colour for the current pixel by finding the most
// common value for each colour channel in the surrounding pixels
private int[] getPixelColour(int[] aSurrounding) {
    int[] _result = new int[3];
    _result[0] = mostFrequent(0, aSurrounding);
    _result[1] = mostFrequent(1, aSurrounding);
    _result[2] = mostFrequent(2, aSurrounding);
    return _result;
}

// find the most frequent colour level for a given channel
// within the surrounding pixels. offset of 0 gives red channel,
// 1 gives green channel, 2 is blue channel
private int mostFrequent(int anOffset, int[] aSurrounding) {
    Counter _c = new Counter();
    int _length = aSurrounding.length-(2-anOffset);
    for (int i=anOffset; i&amp;lt;_length; i+=3) {
        _c.add(aSurrounding[i]);
    }
    return _c.mostFrequent();
}

// relatively efficient counter for quickly racking up 
// a count of occurrences of any given colour level
class Counter {
    int[] values = new int[256];

    public Counter() {
        Arrays.fill(values, -1);
    }

    public void add(int aValue) {
        values[aValue] += 1;
    }

    public int mostFrequent() {
        int _highest = -1;
        int _colour = -1;
        for (int i=0; i&amp;lt;256; i++) {
            if (values[i] &amp;gt; _highest) {
                _highest = values[i];
                _colour = i;
            }
        }
        return _colour;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's what the resulting "vector-effect" image looks like:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h7WklR032Mk/TsRN6coQ38I/AAAAAAAAHsQ/JWkuc8ANBY0/s290/vector-effect.png">
      <div class="caption">4x4 sample grid</div>
    </th>
    <th>
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vsw4wvURlK4/TsRJkaFlyBI/AAAAAAAAHr0/B8JSW3ZA7yQ/s290/vector-effect.png">
      <div class="caption">8x8 sample grid</div>
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Because of the low resolution of this image, a large grid size quickly reduces the resultant image quality. On larger images (e.g. 8MP photos) a 16x16 or even 32x32 grid produces good results. The time to render is proportional to the grid size though.</p>

<h2>Me Again</h2>

<p>Here's the results of processing my viking-hat picture with four different grid sizes: 2x2, 4x4, 8x8 and 16x16. You can see that at such a low resolution the image quickly degenerates with a large grid size - I'm looking pretty demonic by the time we get to 16x16:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NuogXfqNWmA/TsRU2sshuKI/AAAAAAAAHtM/ikSxFtH3i9w/s291/after-2x2.png"><div class="caption">2x2</div></th>
    <th><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hE6Z_o9mrR4/TsRU2ohWggI/AAAAAAAAHtQ/cTkyx-gYM9I/s291/after-4x4.png"><div class="caption">4x4</div></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w37U7iH5tfg/TsRU2qiVWXI/AAAAAAAAHtI/0Id8prE6AZ4/s291/after-8x8.png"><div class="caption">8x8</div></th>
    <th><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZViGZb-uaIA/TsRVE7M2jRI/AAAAAAAAHts/3yFJbGNleX4/s291/after-16x16.png"><div class="caption">16x16</div></th>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>A High-Resolution Image</h2>

<p>An 8MP image (3456x2304) processed with a 16x16 grid takes about 50 seconds on my quad-core i7 laptop. The same image processed with an 8x8 grid takes 27 seconds.</p>

<p>This last image was processed at its full size (3456x2304) with a 16x16 grid, then the result was cropped and resized (by more than 50%) in GIMP to fit the width of my blog.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JiE1KHRC6qs/TsRPaJYe7OI/AAAAAAAAHss/kYIP-Llk-0k/s600/vector-16x16.png">
      <div class="caption">vector effect, using a 16x16 grid</div>
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Well its still some way off from the clean look that Vector Magic produces, but I think its a good start. I'm going to try some ideas to de-fuzz and clean up the edges a bit.</p>

<p>After that ... I'm wondering if I can take the next step and identify bounds for the areas of colour, and thus create a vector image from my "vector-effect" bitmaps?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many good syntax-highlighters available for progressively enhancing code on website's such as my blog. On my old blog I used <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbachev's</a> - which is exceptionally good.</p>

<p>For this blog, I really wanted to write my own. Why? Well, for the same reason I wrote the site-generation software that builds the blog from Markdown templates - because I love programming, and doing this stuff is FUN!</p>

<p>Having just released my <code>GWT.Progressive</code> library I had two very good reasons to write a syntax-highlighter that works by progressive-enhancement:</p>

<ol>
<li>I need good examples of progressive enhancement written in <code>GWT</code> using <code>GWT.Progressive</code></li>
<li>Those very same code-samples need syntax-highlighting to aid readability!</li>
</ol>

<p>For this first attempt I'm not setting out to write the world's greatest syntax-highlighter. My aims are more modest: merely to illustrate the <code>GWT.Progressive</code> library and add basic syntax-highlighting (Java) capabilities to my blog.</p>

<p>The syntax-highlighter will work as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>After the page is loaded, identify <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> blocks on my blog.</li>
<li>Try to ascertain if the text in the block is Java, or a similar language (e.g. JavaScript).</li>
<li>Mark keywords, literals, comments, and a few other choice elements using inline html markup to add css classes, allowing the actual colours and styles to be selected independently of the process of identify the parts to highlight.</li>
</ol>

<p>The script that kicks this off is loaded by the very last line in the html body of each page on my blog:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script 
  type="text/javascript" language="javascript" 
  src="blog/blog.nocache.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Java class that uses the <code>GWT.Progressive</code> library to scan for <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks is, in full, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>package com.sjl.blog.client.syntax;

import com.google.gwt.core.client.*;
import com.google.gwt.dom.client.*;
import com.knowledgeview.gwt.activator.client.*;
import com.knowledgeview.gwt.activator.client.widgets.*;

@RootBinding(tag="code")
public class Code extends BoundRootPanel {
    interface MyActivator extends ElementActivator&lt;Code&gt;{}
    static MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyActivator.class);

    static JavaSyntaxHighlighter highlighter = 
        new JavaSyntaxHighlighter();

    public Code(Element anElement) {
        setElement(activator.activate(this, anElement));

        if (isJavaCode(getElement().getInnerText())) {
            getElement().setInnerHTML(
                highlighter.highlight(getElement().getInnerText()));
        }
    }

    private boolean isJavaCode(String aString) {
        return !aString.trim().startsWith("&lt;");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>GWT</code> module descriptor looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module rename-to="blog"&gt;
  &lt;inherits name="com.google.gwt.user.User"/&gt;
  &lt;inherits name="com.google.gwt.user.Debug"/&gt;

  &lt;inherits name="com.sjl.gwt.progressive.Progressive"/&gt;
  &lt;entry-point class="com.sjl.blog.client.BlogApplication" /&gt;

      &lt;!-- allows the script to be used cross domain --&gt;
  &lt;add-linker name="xs" /&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I will take the time to write a better highlighter some time in the future (using ANTLR or similar to generate a parser), but for now I knocked up a simple version using regular expressions.</p>

<p>This highlighter was built by TDD'ing my way through highlighting the different components, starting simple with keywords. The design changed a few times along the way, but in total, including the <code>Code</code> class, the finished highlighter took around 90 minutes to build.</p>

<p>The slowest part, actually, was round-trip testing and fixing "for real" with GWT production mode, since the <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.4/com/google/gwt/regexp/shared/RegExp.html">difference in regular expression engines</a> between development and production mode caught me out.</p>

<p>Here's the Java syntax highlighter in full:</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<h2>Easy Progressive-Enhancement with GWT</h2>

<p>Progressive-enhancement is a technique for delivering a basic website suitable for search-engines and older web-browsers, then layering on polish, effects, interactivity and general goodness using javascript - the idea being to have a graceful degradation of service, not an all-or-nothing experience.</p>

<p>Traditionally <code>GWT</code> works the other way around - it builds all of the <code>DOM</code> structure of your web-app in script, so search-engines (and browsers with script disabled) only see an inscrutable mass of script.</p>

<p><code>GWT.Progressive</code> helps to bring your ninja <code>GWT</code> skills to bear on web-sites that need progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>You can get <code>GWT.Progressive</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/gwt-progressive">git repository</a> at github.</p>

<h2>What can GWT.Progressive do for me?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bind <code>GWT</code> widgets to html elements on static (or server-generated) html pages, using the html as a template and <code>GWT</code> magic to "enhance" the user-experience</li>
<li>Automatically bind nested html elements to properties of widget classes (child widgets, grand-child widgets, etc)</li>
<li>Bind repeated html elements to <code>List&lt;MyWidgetClass&gt;</code> properties of widget classes</li>
<li>Automatically bind attributes of html elements to properties of widget classes - with automatic type coercion</li>
<li>Make partial page-updates a breeze (replacing parts of the <code>DOM</code> with new server-generated content)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How GWT.Progressive works</h2>

<h3>Element Binding</h3>

<p>You can bind a <code>GWT</code> widget to any html element on your website - just by adding an annotation to the widget class:</p>

<pre><code>// bind by id
@RootBinding(id="mywidget")
class MyWidget extends Composite {
    //...
}

// bind by tag name
@RootBinding(tag="h1")
class MyWidget extends Composite {
   //...
}

// bind by css class
@RootBinding(cssClass="bind-me")
class MyWidget extends Composite {
   //...
}

// bind by tag name and css class
@RootBinding(tag="div", cssClass="bind-me")
class MyWidget extends Composite {
   //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Bind nested html to child widgets:</p>

<pre><code>// bind the first &amp;lt;h1&gt; tag we find by breadth first
// search of the DOM within our widget's root element
@RuntimeUiWidget(tag="h1") MyHeaderWidget header;

// bind the first element we find by breadth first
// search that has the css class "foo"
@RuntimeUiWidget(cssClass="foo") MyFooWidget foo;
</code></pre>

<p>Bind repeated elements to a List of child widgets:</p>

<pre><code>// bind all the &amp;lt;img&gt; elements we find inside our
// widget's root element to the list of Image widgets
@RuntimeUiWidget(tag="img") List&lt;Image&gt; images;
</code></pre>

<h3>Attribute Binding</h3>

<p>Bind html attributes as properties of your widgets, with automatic type coercion:</p>

<pre><code>// the following attributes will have their default values (set below)
// overridden by the values of attributes in the html, if they exist
@RuntimeUiAttribute("text-attr") String textAttr = "default";
@RuntimeUiAttribute("int-attr") Integer integerAttr = 22;
@RuntimeUiAttribute("long-attr") Long longAttr = 9L;
@RuntimeUiAttribute("float-attr") Float floatAttr = 2.3f;
@RuntimeUiAttribute("double-attr") Double doubleAttr = 2222222.222d;
@RuntimeUiAttribute("boolean-attr") Boolean booleanAttr = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Bind attributes to custom types by supplying converters - given html like: <code>&lt;div coords="200x400"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code>, automatically bind the coords property of our widget as an instance of Coords, converted by CoordsAttributeConverter...</p>

<p>In the <code>Widget</code> we're binding:</p>

<pre><code>// automatically bind our custom Coords class 
@RuntimeUiAttribute("coords") Coords coords;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Coords</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>class Coords {
    public Integer x, y;
    public Coords(Integer anX, Integer aY) {
        x = anX;
        y = aY;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>AttributeConverter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@RuntimeUiAttributeConverter
public class CoordsAttributeConverter 
extends AttributeConverter&lt;Coords&gt; {
    public Coords convert(String aString) {
        String[] _parts = aString.split("x");
        return new Coords(
            Integer.parseInt(_parts[0]), 
            Integer.parseInt(_parts[1])
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Partial Page Updates</h3>

<p>Replace chunks of html with new html from the server. Your server can provide this html as it pleases - for example you can call servlets, jsp's, PHP or whatever you like to get the html for the replacement. Your widgets will re-bind to the new html after adding it to the <code>DOM</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// UiBinder afficionados will be familiar with this plumbing
// which we'll use to invoke our page update...
interface MyActivator extends ElementActivator&lt;Partial&gt;{}
MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyActivator.class);

// here's the widget we're going to update
@RuntimeUiWidget(tag="div") UpdateMe updateMe;

    ...

// call this method to trigger the update
private void someMethod() {
    activator.update(
        updateMe, "/update-me.jsp", 
        new CallMeWhenUpdated()
    );
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Partial Page Update callbacks</h3>

<p>You can register callbacks to trigger when a partial update completes - successfully or otherwise. Here's a more complete partial update example:</p>

<pre><code>@RootBinding(tag="div")
public class Partial extends BoundRootPanel
    // UiBinder afficionados will be familiar with this
    interface MyActivator extends ElementActivator&lt;Partial&gt;{}
    MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyActivator.class);

    @RuntimeUiWidget(tag="div") UpdateMe updateMe;

    public Partial(Element anElement)
    {
        setElement(activator.activate(this, anElement));

        // Update the page when we're clicked...
        addDomHandler(new ClickHandler() {
            public void onClick(ClickEvent aEvent) {
                activator.update(
                    Partial.this, "/update-me.jsp", 
                    new CallMeWhenUpdated()
                );
            });
        }            
    }, ClickEvent.getType());

    class CallMeWhenUpdated 
    implements PageUpdateCallback&lt;Partial&gt;() {
        public void onSuccess(Partial anUpdated) {
            Window.alert("Updated!");
        }

        public void onError(Throwable anExc) {
            GWT.log("oops, something bad happened", anExc);
        }   
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Complete example - Progressive Enhancement with GWT</h3>

<p>Here's the HTML we're going to enhance:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="widget"&gt;
      &lt;img class="first" src="/image-1.png"&gt;
      &lt;img class="second" src="/image-2.png"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!-- our script loads last, and progressive 
         enhancement begins --&gt;
    &lt;script 
        type="text/javascript" language="javascript" 
        src="example/example.nocache.js?cache=20111112180652"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the widget we're going to bind to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> of css-class "widget":</p>

<pre><code>@RootBinding(cssClass="widget")
class MyWidget extends BoundRootPanel {
    interface MyActivator extends ElementActivator&lt;MyWidget&gt;{}
    MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyWidget.class);

    @RuntimeUiWidget(cssClass="first") Image first;
    @RuntimeUiWidget(cssClass="second") Image second;

    public MyWidget(Element anElement) {
        setElement(activator.activate(this, anElement);

        // ... now we do some enhancements, e.g. add
        // click-handlers to our image's our something
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We'll need an EntryPoint - this is still a <code>GWT</code> application:</p>

<pre><code>class Example1 implements EntryPoint {
    public void onModuleLoad() {
        PageActivator _activator = GWT.create(PageActivator.class);
        _activator.activate();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>... and a <code>GWT</code> module descriptor (<code>.gwt.xml</code>) of course:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module rename-to="example"&gt;
  &lt;inherits name="com.google.gwt.user.User"/&gt;
  &lt;inherits name="com.sjl.gwt.progressive.Progressive"/&gt;

  &lt;entry-point class="com.sjl.example.client.Example" /&gt;

  &lt;!-- for maximum compatibility, use the xs linker --&gt;
  &lt;add-linker name="xs" /&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Rules of engagement</h2>

<p><code>GWT.Progressive</code> requires that you follow a few simple rules to ensure that your widgets get "activated" correctly, integrated into the GWT/browser eventing system, etc.</p>

<p>Your widgets <em>must</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a public <code>Constructor</code> that takes a <code>com.google.gwt.dom.client.Element</code> argument, OR</li>
<li>Have a <code>public static &lt;T&gt; wrap()</code> method that returns an instance of your widget class (this is how native GWT widgets like Image and Label are bound by GWT.Progressive).</li>
<li><code>GWT.create()</code> a special class that allows <code>GWT.Progressive</code>'s generator to work its magic on your widgets (either <code>com.sjl.gwt.progressive.client.ElementActivator</code> or <code>com.sjl.gwt.progressive.client.WidgetActivator</code>).</li>
<li>Set your Widget's Element as the return value from activation (<code>setElement(activator.activate(this, anElement))</code>) or init your Composite with it (<code>initWidget(activator.activate(this, anElement))</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've ever used UiBinder, this pattern will be very familiar to you.</p>

<p>Also, make sure to use the "xs" linker by specifying <code>&lt;add-linker name="xs"/&gt;</code> in your gwt module descriptor for maximum compatibility.</p>

<h3>Where can I find more examples of GWT.progressive?</h3>

<p>In the github repository, in the <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/gwt-progressive/tree/master/src/java/test/com/sjl/gwt/progressive">test source tree</a>.</p>

<h3>Are there any examples in the wild?</h3>

<p>There are two examples on this page! - The Twitter feed in the sidebar, and the code <a href="syntax_highlighting_with_gwt_progressive.html">syntax-highlighting</a> are both implemented using <code>gwt.progressive</code>.</p>

<p>You can also try my mortgage/loan <a href="http://steveliles.website.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">overpayment calculator</a> which is built with gwt.progressive.</p>

<h3>Can I use this in my products?</h3>

<p>Sure, its available under the Apache-2.0 license, but ... disclaimer: use at your own risk and discretion, I cannot accept responsibility for any issues that may arise from using this library.</p>

<h3>Can I modify the code, fix bugs, etc?</h3>

<p>Knock yourself out :) ... I'd love to hear about it if you do.</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>I just want to say - props to my employer (<a href="http://www.knowledgeview.com">KnowledgeView ltd.</a>) for allowing me to release the code, some of which was developed on their dime. Mucho thanks KV :)</p>

<p>You can find some more background on <code>GWT.Progressive</code> in some of my earlier blog posts: <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_1.html">part-1</a>, <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_2.html">part-2</a>, and <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_3.html">part-3</a></p>

<p>I'm using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownj/">MarkdownJ</a> to convert the Markdown syntax to HTML, and <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">FreeMarker</a> for templating.</p>

<p>FreeMarker for templating was an easy choice for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a decent templating engine that I've used recently for a dynamic website,</li>
<li>It is very easy to set up in Java for my one-hit templating needs,</li>
<li>I like its syntax compared to, say, Velocity</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday I used FreeMarker to add two new productions to my site-generator: a sitemap, and an RSS feed, and thought I'd make some quick notes...</p>

<p>FreeMarker strives to be a pure templating language, and as such resists the temptation to ... shall we say, make certain things easy that you probably shouldn't do in a template. </p>

<p>This can make templating a little uncomfortable sometimes - all the more so if you try to use complex domain objects directly in your templates instead of producing model's specifically for output (YMMV depending on the complexity of your domain model of course).</p>

<p>For the simple needs of my Blog FreeMarker has been great, allowing me to whiz up the sitemap template in a couple of minutes, and not much longer for the RSS-2.0 template.</p>

<p>Setting up FreeMarker in Java is very very simple indeed. I chose to abstract FreeMarker away behind my own interface (<code>TemplateProcessor</code>), in case I want to use something different later:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;
import freemarker.template.*;

public class FreemarkerTemplateProcessor implements TemplateProcessor
{
    private Configuration cfg;

    public FreemarkerTemplateProcessor(File aTemplateDir) 
    throws IOException
    {
        cfg = new Configuration();
        cfg.setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(aTemplateDir);
        cfg.setObjectWrapper(new DefaultObjectWrapper());
    }

    @Override
    public void process(Object aModel, String aTemplate, Writer aWriter) 
    throws IOException, TemplateException
    {
        Template _tpl = cfg.getTemplate(aTemplate);
        _tpl.process(aModel, aWriter);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The templating language is quite neat, and very easy to write - as I mentioned before, it helps if your model is a good fit for the view you are trying to render so you don't need to squeeze to many conditionals into the template. </p>

<h2>Freemarker template for sitemap.xml</h2>

<p>There are only 3 lines of FreeMarker markup in my sitemap template:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;#list posts as post&gt;</code> which iterates over an <code>Iterable</code> containing <code>Post</code> objects,</li>
<li>the closing <code>&lt;/#list&gt;</code>, and</li>
<li>the line that reads the post's link <code>&lt;loc&gt;${blog.url}/${post.link}&lt;/loc&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the template in full:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;urlset xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation=
        "http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9 
        http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd"
  xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt; 

  &lt;url&gt;
    &lt;loc&gt;${blog.url}/index.html&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;changefreq&gt;daily&lt;/changefreq&gt;
    &lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;
  &lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;url&gt;
    &lt;loc&gt;${blog.url}/about_me.html&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;changefreq&gt;daily&lt;/changefreq&gt;
    &lt;priority&gt;0.9&lt;/priority&gt;
  &lt;/url&gt;

  &lt;#list posts as post&gt;
    &lt;url&gt; 
      &lt;loc&gt;${blog.url}/${post.link}&lt;/loc&gt;
      &lt;changefreq&gt;hourly&lt;/changefreq&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;

&lt;/urlset&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Freemarker template for RSS 2.0</h2>

<p>The RSS template is very similar to the sitemap template, as it deals with exactly the same model. Skipping the pre-amble, here's the part that actually involves any freemarker markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;#list posts as post&gt;
  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[${post.title}]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;&lt;![CDATA[http://${blog.url}/${post.link}]]&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;guid isPermaLink="true"&gt;${blog.url}/${post.link}&lt;/guid&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;&lt;![CDATA[${post.body}]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;#list post.keywords as keyword&gt;
      &lt;category&gt;${keyword}&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/#list&gt;
    &lt;dc:creator&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ Steve Liles ]]&gt;&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
    &lt;pubDate&gt;${post.date?string("EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z")}&lt;/pubDate&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I like the date built-in here: <code>${post.date?string("EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z")}</code> which keeps the date format in the template where it belongs. </p>

<p>Of course, here I've just written it directly into this template because I only use this format once in my whole site - if I were using it more I could define a re-usable FreeMarker macro instead to avoid repetition.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>GWT JavaScriptObject's and JavaScript Overlays are very cool. I've written about them <a href="gwt_javascriptobjects_javascript_overlays.html">before</a>. It can get a bit tiresome to write jsni methods though, especially all those fiddly slashes, braces and asterisks at the end!</p>

<p>Here's a simple Eclipse code template that does the hard work for you, and lets you quickly tab-and-type through to completing your jsni method without ever having to type those fiddles again:</p>

<pre><code>public final native ${return_type} ${newName}()/*-{ 
    ${cursor} 
}-*/;
</code></pre>

<p>To add this in Eclipse:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the preferences dialog (Window -> Preferences)</li>
<li>Type "templates" into the filter box (it should have focus already so you can just start typing)</li>
<li>Select the bold entry under "Java -> Editor -> Templates"</li>
<li>In the right hand panel you'll see all the existing templates, and some buttons ... Click "New"</li>
<li>The "name" is also the shortcut for your new template, so enter "jsni"</li>
<li>Paste in the template text (copy from the code block above).</li>
<li>Click ok to return to prefs, and ok again to return to the editor and try it out ...</li>
</ol>

<p>To use your new template:</p>

<ol>
<li>Type "jsni" (without quotes) into a java editor and hit ctrl-space (or whatever your auto-complete shortcut is)</li>
<li>The first option in the auto-complete suggestions should be your "jsni" template - hit return to use it</li>
<li>Your template appears, and eclipse focuses the first part (the return type) for you to modify</li>
<li>Modify each part of the template in turn and press tab to move to the next part</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<p>Recent releases of the Google Eclipse plugin include some <a href="http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/gwt_jsni.html">nice jsni features</a> that you definitely don't want to miss out on - including code-completion and syntax highlighting.</p>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/what_makes_a_good_developer.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the year I worked with our Operations Manager in Beirut - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bassel-beaini/26/553/291">Bassel Beaini</a> - to do annual reviews for our whole development (and UX) team there. </p>

<p>As part of the review process we gave the developers an updated job specification, which I wanted to be both prescriptive and aspirational - the idea being to describe the role each should currently be playing, to make very clear what would be needed to move to the next level, and at the same time to make everyone want to up their game and take it to the next level.</p>

<p>The end result, I guess, is my attempt at a technology agnostic description of what makes a good developer. Being a developer myself I'm fairly biased towards the technical aspects of the role and probably tend to somewhat overlook the human side of things (team-work, interaction with other parts of the business incl. non-programmers, etc). I'd love to hear constructive feedback on how I could improve these descriptions for next year :)</p>

<p>Here are the "aspirational" parts of the job descriptions I wrote for the top-tiers - architect/expert and senior developer:</p>

<h2>Architect/Expert Developer</h2>

<p>A passionate technologist, you demonstrate excitement, deep interest and knowledge of all aspects of development: languages; paradigms; patterns; idioms; platforms; performance; reliability; scalability; quality; tools and technologies. You relish the challenge of hugely complex problems.</p>

<p>Possessing true mastery of at least one modern programming language and paradigm, along with advanced knowledge of idioms and Design Patterns and when (or when not) to apply them, you will be able to recognize opportunities to improve code at a glance, and have the confidence and competence to take these opportunities to refactor towards better design.</p>

<p>You must be able to explain at length the reasons behind (micro)architectural decisions you make - or help others to make - so that others may learn from you. Your code has a finesse and indescribable quality that is the envy of all who read and work with it. You have exceptional ability to narrow down potential sources of a problem, hone in on the root-cause, and propose a range of solutions and explain their pros and cons.</p>

<p>Your architectural skills allow you both to describe designs at a high level to the business, and also to hone in on the complexities and details that allow a design to be implemented successfully. You are able to interpret and translate abstract ideas from more business oriented colleagues and customers, and from those ideas produce designs and specifications for developers to implement. You will be able to identify and separate the real requirements from the incidental details that inevitably form part of such brain-storming or business driven interaction.</p>

<p>You will have excellent understanding and wider knowledge of development tools and processes, and be able to clearly explain, demonstrate, and teach their usage to others, especially those junior to yourself who may have no prior experience. You will be aware of facets of these tools and processes that are not in daily use, such that you will be able to turn these tools even more to your advantage in specific situations. You will be constantly looking for new ways to streamline your working practices and those of the team through use of new and existing tools and technologies.</p>

<p>As one of the most senior members of the development team you will set an excellent example of engineering discipline to your colleagues, and will be passionate about achieving the very best quality and helping those around you to do so. You will recognize and evangelize the benefits of engineering disciplines such as source-code control, unit-testing, and code-review, and have a very self-critical view of what constitutes "done".</p>

<p>You will delight in tackling a range of tasks, recognizing the pleasure to be found in a polished solution to the smallest problem, as well as the challenges of a more significant undertaking, and you will enjoy mentoring and engaging in discussion about all aspects of development with your colleagues.</p>

<h2>Senior Developer</h2>

<p>You are the kind of person who develops software for fun in your spare time - whether personal projects or open-source contributions. You are deeply interested in languages, paradigms, idioms, tools and technologies, and in solving difficult problems.</p>

<p>You take great pride in your work, and it shows clearly in the way your code speaks to others - simple, clean, thoroughly unit-tested and easily understood and maintained. You are able to recognize and fix many code-smells and can gently point them out to your less experienced colleagues during code-review. You are keen to develop your skills further through interaction with your colleagues - junior and senior - and by consistently executing any task, large or small, with the attitude that there is always something new to learn. You can quickly identify and fix problems from minimal descriptions.</p>

<p>You are accomplished at taking high level designs and specifications from Architects and implementing them successfully, including creating and assigning suitable sub-tasks to less advanced members of your team. You can articulately explain the reasons behind micro-architectural choices you make during implementation, and evaluate the pros and cons of such decisions.</p>

<p>You will have excellent understanding and wider knowledge of development tools and processes, and be able to clearly explain, demonstrate, and teach their usage to others, especially those junior to yourself who may have little or no prior experience. You will be so confident with and reliant upon these tools that you use them even for your personal projects, knowing that the benefits are well worth the extra up-front effort.</p>

<p>You will set an excellent example of engineering discipline to your peers and junior colleagues, and you understand and truly believe in the need for engineering discipline and processes in delivering high quality software. Your attitude toward any task is to produce the best solution you can and learn from the experience. You will actively seek feedback on your solutions from peers and senior colleagues, whether by code-review or less formal discussion.</p>

<p>If you're in Beirut, are a serious Java or Objective-C hacker, and would like to work with us, drop a comment, contact <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/steveliles">me</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bassel-beaini/26/553/291">Bassel</a> via linked-in, or tweet me (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/steveliles">@steveliles</a>)</p>

        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_javascriptobjects_javascript_overlays.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_javascriptobjects_javascript_overlays.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>GWT has a fantastic tool for "overlaying" java (GWT) classes on JSON objects such that you don't have to write any parsing code to parse a piece of JSON. There are some nice articles about this from the GWT folks themselves, for example <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay.html">this one</a>. The gist of it is, given some JSON like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "item": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "cheese",
    "type": "food"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>we can "overlay" a java class onto that JSON, and have the GWT compiler (and the browser's native JSON parsing) do the marshalling for us. </p>

<h2>JavaScript Overlay Types</h2>

<p>We do that by writing a JavaScript Overlay Type class that maps the native json data back to the the world of your Java code, and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Item extends JavaScriptObject
{
    protected Item(){}

    public final native Integer getId()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getName()/*-{ 
        return this.name; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getType()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>JSNI Methods</h2>

<p>Those three native methods are known in GWT-land as JSNI methods (JavaScript Native Interface), and the part in comments at the end is actually pure JavaScript that you can write to directly access parts of the JSON object. </p>

<p>In these native JSNI sections the "this" object being referred to is the JSON object itself, and although I've only shown very simple property access here you can in fact perform more complex operations if you like.</p>

<p>The return values from our JSNI can be Java's primitive wrappers or String, any class that extends JavaScriptObject (JSO), or one of a number of special JSO classes GWT provides such as JsArray, JsIterable, JsArrayString, etc.</p>

<p>I have exclusively used jsni methods in my example above, but you can include pure java methods as well (provided they are final) - say, for example, we need to parse a date from some json:</p>

<pre><code>public class Item extends JavaScriptObject
{
    private static final DateTimeFormat df = 
        DateTimeFormat.getFormat("yyyyMMdd");

    protected Item(){}

    public final Date whenCreated() {
        return df.parse(getCreateDateString());
    }

    public final native Integer getId()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getName()/*-{ 
        return this.name; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getType()/*-{ 
        return this.id; 
    }-*/;

    public final native String getCreateDateString()/*-{ 
        return this.createDate; 
    }-*/;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Mapping complex types</h2>

<p>These are simple examples of course, but i've had no trouble mapping even the most complex JSON objects using JSO's. You can map arrays easily enough using the built in GWT JsArray types, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Items extends JavaScriptObject
{
    protected Items(){}

    public final native JsArray getItems()/*-{ 
        return this.items; 
    }-*/;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would map the following JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{ items: [
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "cheese",
    "type": "food"
  },
  {
    "id": 456,
    "name": "ham",
    "type": "food"
  },
  {
    "id": 789,
    "name": "eggs",
    "type": "food"
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<h2>JavaScriptObject rules</h2>

<p>There are a couple of basic rules to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must have a protected no-arg constructor</li>
<li><em>All</em> methods must be "final"</li>
<li>Must not have any instance fields</li>
<li>May only implement a single Interface</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScriptObject "gotchas"</h2>

<p>With regard to that last point, there's another gotcha to look out for: only one JavaScriptObject class can implement any given interface. Think about that for a minute, because its more of a restriction than you might at first realise...</p>

<p>The whole point of Interfaces is to use them to define a contract that implementations will adhere to, so that multiple poly-morphically interchangeable implementations can be used. With JSO's, you can only have one single JSO implementation of an interface - for example you cannot have several JSO's which implement Iterable. This is for the same reason that all JSO methods must be final - JSO's cannot use dynamic method dispatch.</p>

<p>If you try to implement the same interface in more than one of your JSO's you don't (currently) get any warnings from the compiler ... instead you get crazy runtime behaviour due to the wrong JSO class's methods being invoked (because one of your JSO's will receive all method invocations for the interface, regardless of which class the method should have been invoked against).</p>

<p>Interestingly I ran into a problem in the latest GWT release (2.4) that reported a very unhelpful error message (I'm sure the messages in earlier releases of GWT were much more helpful actually). Here's the error message I got:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ClassFormatError: Illegal method name "$"
 in class com/xxx/xxx/client/model/UserResult
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(ClassLoader.java:631)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:615)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:465)
 at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.CompilingClassLoader.findClass
    (CompilingClassLoader.java:1085)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247)
</code></pre>

<p>... as it turns out, the problem actually was that I broke one of the rules - I had a non-final method in my JavaScriptObject. Not a very helpful error message in this case, which is fairly unusual in my experience of GWT.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I like to feel productive. Actually that's a huge understatement. If I'm not feeling productive I get quite unhappy. For me feeling productive goes hand in hand with creative output - something that produces a tangible artifact - and I find it difficult to satisfy my need for productivity with intangible things like meetings.</p>

<p>Even more than that, I need to be deeply involved in the creative activity - part of the group doing the creative stuff rather than managing it from a distance.</p>

<p>This post has been brewing for a while, and I finally began composing it last week. At the weekend I ran out of Kindle-fodder and bought <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ericries">@ericries</a> 's new book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0670921602">The Lean Startup</a>, and was amazed and pleased to hit upon the following quote, which said it all much better than I could: </p>

<blockquote>"When people are used to evaluating their productivity locally, they feel that a good day is one in which they did their job well all day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When I worked as a programmer, that meant eight straight hours of programming without interruption. That was a good day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In contrast, if I was interrupted with questions, process, or - heaven forbid - meetings, I felt bad. What did I really accomplish that day? Code and product features were tangible to me; I could see them, understand them, and show them off. Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible."</blockquote>
-- Eric Ries, in The Lean Startup

<p>Now I agree with almost all of that quote, except for the last sentence where I think the word "learning" is in some ways not fitting. I think Eric meant to encompass questions, process, meetings, and many other things in "learning", in which case I'd agree with him, but there certain kinds of "learning" which I find very productive. </p>

<p>Recently I've been exploring some new avenues in my work - straying away from spending all day coding and venturing into developing product ideas. At first it felt very uncomfortable and I didn't feel at all productive. Lately though I'm coming around to it. </p>

<p>For me part of the way through has been to find ways to turn what I'm thinking and doing into tangible artifacts that require some creative effort to produce - for example: drawing UI wireframes, writing up meetings and brainstorming sessions, and developing ideas in essay form. </p>

<p>By committing &amp;ideas to disk I've started to feel productive again. Perhaps its just a safety blanket really, but it feels good, and the best bit is that with each new artifact, essay, description, and wireframe I can link to previous artifacts for reference, backup or explanation (all are available online in our basecamp account), and the conversation gets richer. </p>

<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zYYLyGL6IF8/Tnuwx1j5bHI/AAAAAAAAHmU/ohE6yl1bFQU/s554/Screenshot-Portable%2BDevices%2BBusiness%2BUnit%2B%253E%2BEasy%2BPublish%253A%2Bassumptions%2Band%2Buse-cases%2B-%2BGoogle%2BChrome-1.png" alt="Basecamp Messages" /> </p>

<p>I've begun to wonder if some of my feeling of productivity actually comes from spending a certain amount of time each day in a state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">flow</a>), and if I don't get to spend some time each day in that state then I feel less happy and productive. </p>

<p>There are a few activities - mostly creative in some way - during which I find myself zoning out and really getting immersed in what i'm doing: coding; drawing; reading (novels); and - with a bit of effort - writing. Once i'm tuned out I can go on for hours without feeling time passing. </p>

<p>When I'm coding at home, with no distractions, I'll sit at the table in morning when my wife leaves for work and will hardly have moved by the time she comes home. I've noticed that I even realize, sometimes, that i'm in this state and have a "lucid flow" moment akin to lucid dreaming. Usually I get this when I hit a turning point in my work: when I've been working on a problem for a couple of hours and finally feel the complete shape of the solution in my head - I'm as deep into the problem as I'm going to get, I can start unwinding the mental stack, and from here on in progress is going to get quicker and quicker. Love that feeling. </p>

<p>Coding is the creative activity that I spend most time on, so its also the activity that most often gets me into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))">flow</a>, but I find the most powerful activity for flow is drawing.</p>
<p>I suspect this has a lot to do with the difference between coding and drawing - the fact that coding requires the language centres of the brain to be active. Betty Edwards has quite a bit to say on this in Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, which is an interesting read if you can draw reasonably well, but presumably a revelation if you've never been able to draw.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I didn't intend to have an about me page, but it turns out that to get google to display my mugshot next to search listings I have to have one. So here it is.</p>

  <p>This is me, the grinning idiot in the viking hat. Sadly I no longer have the hat.</p>

<p>I graduated from Reading University with a BSc hons. degree in Computer Science and <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/cybernetics/">Cybernetics</a>, and immediately started work as a programmer at <a href="http://www.baesystems.com/">British Aerospace</a>, where I stayed for about a year and a half.</p>

<p>Next I moved on to work at a much smaller and more exciting company - <a href="http://www.knowledgeview.com">KnowledgeView</a> - where I have spent the last 11 years (oh me, oh my) developing a variety of web-based Editorial, Publishing and Syndication systems for news publishers - many based in the Middle-East and working and publishing in Arabic. We also build native and web apps for iPhone, iPad and Android devices to complement our publishing systems. </p>

<p>My current title is "Development Manager", though I think the job description would be better represented by the title "Chief Engineer". (A peculiar quirk of being a programmer is that you become a <a href="http://rcm-uk.amazon.co.uk/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=stlibl-21&amp;o=2&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B005LI3W9W]">pedant for nomenclature</a>). </p>

<p>I still code every day, for as many hours as I can. My "management style", if I have such a thing, is to lead by example. I care a lot about writing good code, using good tools, and leaving things in a better state than I found them. I try hard to <a href="what_makes_a_good_developer.html">enthuse my team</a> to the same ideals.</p>

<p>KnowledgeView is still small, though we have a growing team in Beirut. It's also occasionally quite exciting, otherwise I wouldn't still be there. Over the years we've had many high-profile customers, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newsint.co.uk/">News International</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cnnarabic.com">CNN arabic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.inmplc.com/">Independent News and Media</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.srmg.com/en">Saudi Research and Media Group</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.daralhayat.com/">Al-Hayat Newspaper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alquds.co.uk/">Al-Quds</a></li>
<li>... and many more besides</li>
</ul>

<p>When I'm not at work I divide my time between growing veg on my allotment (conveniently just outside my garden gate) and working on my personal programming projects. </p>

<p>I believe that programming is the most fun a person can have on their own, and I often wonder if non-programmers know what they are missing out on. I sometimes find time to <a href="some_old_sketches.html">draw</a>, and wish I could find <a href="more_old_sketches.html">more</a>.</p>

        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/my_first_android_app_desktop_widget.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/my_first_android_app_desktop_widget.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Having spent quite a bit of time away from Eclipse lately I've been itching to play with some code again. During a short meeting this morning an idea hit me for a really simple Android desktop widget: a twitter search widget that you can drop on your desktop and configure with a hash-tag search.</p>

<p>Here's how it looks in the Android emulator:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vquQDRX3D2Y/TmjCGIscAiI/AAAAAAAAHlw/g0nU2gdPnug/s815/tweet-widget.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>I know, not exactly eye-candy, but that wasn't really the point :)</p>

<h3>The important pieces of the puzzle are:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A BroadcastReceiver that receives events telling the widget to update. Here I extended AppWidgetProvider to override onUpdate only.</li>
<li>A Service that does the Twitter API request asynchronously - we don't want to use the UI thread and fail the responsiveness criteria</li>
<li>The "widget info" descriptor xml</li>
<li>Android manifest entries that register the Service and the broadcast receiver</li>
<li>SAX ContentHandler implementation to parse the Tweet text from the atom response to the Twitter API request</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the code, currently wired to display a search for "#uml"</p>

<h4>The BroadcastReceiver</h4>

<pre><code>public class NewsTicker extends AppWidgetProvider {
    @Override
    public void onUpdate(Context aContext, 
        AppWidgetManager aAppWidgetManager, 
        int[] aAppWidgetIds) {
        super.onUpdate(aContext, aAppWidgetManager, aAppWidgetIds);
        aContext.startService(
            new Intent(aContext, NewsTickerDataService.class));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4>The Service</h4>

<pre><code>public class NewsTickerDataService extends Service {

    @Override
    public void onStart(Intent aIntent, int aStartId) {
        super.onStart(aIntent, aStartId);   
        RemoteViews _views = buildUpdatedViews(this);   
        ComponentName _widget = 
            new ComponentName(this, NewsTicker.class);
        AppWidgetManager _manager = 
            AppWidgetManager.getInstance(this); 
        _manager.updateAppWidget(_widget, _views);
    }

    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent aParamIntent) {
        // not supporting binding   
        return null;
    }

    private RemoteViews buildUpdatedViews(Context aContext) {
        List&amp;lt;Story&gt; _stories = getStories();
        RemoteViews _result = new RemoteViews(
            aContext.getPackageName(), 
            R.layout.newsticker_widget
        );

        if (_stories.isEmpty()) {
            _result.setTextViewText(R.id.title, 
                "Sadly there's nothing to read today.");
        } else {
            _result.setTextViewText(
                R.id.title, _stories.get(0).getTitle());
        }
        return _result;
    }

        try {
            URL _url = new URL("http://search.twitter.com" +
                "/search.atom?q=%23uml&amp;" + 
                "result_type=mixed&amp;count=5"
            );
            InputStream _in = _url.openStream();
            return parse(new InputSource(_in));
        } catch (Exception anExc) {
            Log.e("NewsTicker", anExc.getMessage(), anExc);
            return new ArrayList&amp;lt;Story&gt;();
        }
    }

    private List&amp;lt;Story&gt; parse(InputSource aSource)
    throws Exception {
        SAXParserFactory _f = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
        SAXParser _p = _f.newSAXParser();
        XMLReader _r = _p.getXMLReader();

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I had a problem where a multi-threaded testcase which runs fine on my 8-core dev box failed when committed to the single-cpu build-server.</p>

<p>To replicate I needed to run on a single-cpu but I didn't want to commit more potentially broken tests to source-control and run repeatedly breaking builds on the build-server.</p>

<p>I discovered that its possible to bind an exec'd process to a single CPU in newer 'nix's using taskset. Invoking my maven build using taskset to bind the test-run to a single CPU core replicated the failure immediately, and from there it was an easy fix. Here's the cmdline to bind a maven build to a single CPU (I'm running Ubuntu, YMMV):</p>

<pre><code>taskset -pc 0 mvn clean test
</code></pre>

<p>tasket is part of schedutils, which you may or may not have installed. It was installed on my machine already, possibly because of other things i've installed in the past. If needed you can install it with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install schedutils
</code></pre>

<p>It basically sets processor affinity by setting some process properties that tell the linux cpu scheduler to only allow the process to run on the stated CPU's.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>For those who don't care about the back-story and just want the solution: switch the user-agent to Firefox by using the WebClient constructor that takes a BrowserVersion parameter.</p>

<p>...
One of my colleagues wrote a htmlunit test that involved swiftly navigating through a set of pages. The test checked the behaviour was correct and passed just fine, but left behind a very large number of messages like this:</p>

<pre><code>runtimeError: message=
  [The data necessary to complete this operation is not yet available.]
  sourceName=[http://localhost:10821/js/jquery-1.6.1.js] line=[16]
  lineSource=[null] lineOffset=[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This was looking pretty nasty in the hudson and mvn build logs, so I investigated a little to see if I could get rid of it.</p>

<p>First step was to try to figure out what part of the jquery script was triggering the problem, but of course we are using the minified jquery script, so it was impossible to find the problem on line 16 (line 16 is jquery).</p>

<p>Replacing the minified script with the "source" version I get the same error reported at line 923. It's doing the following check:</p>

<pre><code>// The DOM ready check for Internet Explorer
function doScrollCheck() {
 if ( jQuery.isReady ) {
  return;
 }

 try {
  // If IE is used, use the trick by Diego Perini
  // http://javascript.nwbox.com/IEContentLoaded/
     document.documentElement.doScroll("left");
 } catch(e) {
  setTimeout( doScrollCheck, 1 );
  return;
 }

 // and execute any waiting functions
 jQuery.ready();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Line 923 is the one inside the try block. Of course, this is a an IE specific check, and the default user-agent mimicked by HtmlUnit is Internet Explorer 7 - and yes, we were using the default.</p>

<p>You can change the default by passing a BrowserVersion parameter to the WebClient constructor. Switch to Firefox 3 or 3.6 and the problem goes away, switch to IE8 and it gets worse (test fails) - although it seems this is for different reasons, not related to the doScrollCheck. Can't even escape browser version troubles when not using a browser :(</p>

<p>Incidentally I <a href="http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/25-dev-tool-secrets/">discovered recently</a> that many of the latest browsers and developer plugins can "unminify" javascript on the fly.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>More and more I find myself enjoying the "Tell, Don't Ask" style of programming, to the extent that recently I've been challenging myself to write all my code that way. </p>

<p>This brought up an interesting discussion while working on a proto-type with an excellent developer I've known and worked with for years - how do you test code written in this style?</p>

<h3>Setting the scene</h3>

<p>The idea of the proto-type was to play with and test out several Entity-Extraction and Text-Clustering algorithms - some that we had researched, some using existing libraries, and others of our own devising. We collected a few dozen Mb-worth of sample data to toy with, and I knocked up a quick harness to feed the test data into the Entity-Extraction and Test-Clustering routines, which just needed to implement a bunch of Java interfaces I'd written (using "Tell, Don't Ask" style). Each of us then proceeded to implement some of the algorithms, which we plugged in Strategy-Pattern style.</p>

<p>Every so often as we were working, my colleague would turn and say something like "I need to add Xxxx to the Yyyy interface, so I can unit-test my implementation". His feeling was that whilst in principle "Tell, Don't Ask" is laudable, it makes testing very awkward and ungainly.</p>

<p>As a result the interfaces drifted away from "Tell, Don't Ask" so that, whilst they still included the callback-style methods, they now presented a more typical "Ask" style API too - a simple example being: implementing <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code> as well as providing <code>each(T)</code> methods.</p>

<h3>Example Tests</h3>

<p>Let's look at a simple example of the kind of tests that appear to be made difficult due to the "Tell, Don't Ask" style. Note that I'm using junit 3.8 style for these examples.</p>

<p>Say we have a Stuff interface, which is an immutable container of Thing's, and a ThingMaker that creates many Thing's and returns them packed in a Stuff.  Here are the "Tell, Don't Ask" interfaces we might have started off with:</p>

<pre><code>  public interface Thing {
    public String getName();
    public void doThings();
  }

  public interface ThingCallback {
    public void with(Thing thing);
  }

  public interface Stuff {
    public void each(ThingCallback callback);
  }

  public interface ThingMaker {
    public Stuff makeThings(int howMany);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty straight-forward. Now, lets see what happens when we want to test that when we ask the ThingMaker to make two Thing's, we actually get two non-null Thing's. Here's what the test method might look like:</p>

<pre><code>public void testMakesCorrectNumberOfThings() {
  ThingMaker tm = new SimpleThingMaker();
  Stuff result = tm.makeThings(2);

  final boolean[] calledBack = new boolean[1];
  final int[] count = new int[1];

  result.each(new ThingCallback() {
    public void with(Thing thing) {
      calledBack[0] = true;
      if (thing != null) {
        count[0] = count[0]++;
      }
    }
  });

  assertTrue(calledBack[0]);
  assertEquals(2, count.length);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yikes, that's pretty nasty. What's all that nonsense with the final arrays? Well, given that we're working in an anonymous inner class (the callback) we can't just update a boolean or an int that we've declared in the enclosing scope, the only option we have is to cheat and use final variables that have mutable content - arrays are a cheap way to do that. But I think you'll agree this is hideous.</p>

<p>An alternative is to make the inner class do the checking and counting. To do that we have to raise its profile somewhat, to make it a named inner class:</p>

<pre><code>  class TestThingCallback implements ThingCallback {
    boolean called;
    int count;

    public void with(Thing thing) {
      called = true;
      count++;
    }
  }

  public void testMakesCorrectNumberOfThings() {
    ThingMaker tm = new SimpleThingMaker();
    Stuff result = tm.makeThings(2);

    TestThingCallback cb = new TestThingCallback();
    result.each(cb);

    assertTrue(cb.called);
    assertEquals(2, cb.count);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>OK, well that's a lot better, but the effort of making these "Test Spy" objects grows very quickly, and although this is more readable it somehow feels less concise, and by moving code outside of the test-method it makes it just that little bit more awkward to read.</p>

<p>I think this shows that "classical" unit testing of "Tell, Don't Ask" style code is actually awkward enough to want to find a better way. But can we do any better? Absolutely ...</p>

<h3>Enter, jMock</h3>

<p>jMock is an astonishingly useful tool in the testing arsenal. It makes truly unit testing your code possible without masses of work creating Test Double's, because it does all the grunt work for you. Lets quickly re-write our test using jmock.</p>

<pre><code>  public class TestCaseThingMaker extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testMakesCorrectNumberOfThings() {
      final ThingCallback callback = mock(ThingCallback.class);
      checking(new Expectations(){{
        exactly(2).of(callback).each(with(any(Thing.class)));
      }});

      ThingMaker tm = new SimpleThingMaker();
      Stuff result = tm.makeThings(2);
      result.each(callback);
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Some of that might need a little explanation, so here goes:</p>

<p>The first thing we do inside our test method is create a "mock" instance of the ThingCallback interface. jMock does this for you in the invocation of the mock method.</p>

<p>Next we set up our "expectations" of what will happen to the mock ThingCallback during our test. The slightly funky syntax with the double braces is just an instance initializer on an anonymous inner class. The interesting bit is the declaration of what we expect to happen to our mock object - this is the bit inside those {{ ... }} written in jMock's intuitive internal DSL. To understand it you just have to read the whole line from left to right - we're expecting exactly 2 invocations of callback.each() with any instance of Thing.</p>

<p>Once we've set up our expectations it only remains to build the object under test - SimpleThingMaker - and invoke the methods we want to test.
If you are staring at that and wondering how JMock knows that the test is finished and the expectations should have been met (and that it should fail the test if not), notice that I'm using the JUnit-3 integration here - extending MockObjectTestCase - and the behind the scenes plumbing is taking care of that last step for me. </p>

<p>If you're using the JUnit-4 integration you need to explicitly invoke assertIsSatisfied on the mock object context (org.jmock.Mockery) which supplied your mock objects.
jMock takes a little getting used to, as it involves quite a different way of thinking about your test. If you want to write good tests with it it certainly involves considerable effort to learn how to use it well (its easy to use it badly and end up with tests which are very difficult to understand). Once you get used to it though, it really does make tests much easier to write and, more importantly, to read.</p>

<p>I find that jMock really comes into its own when testing Tell, Don't Ask code - the code under test is clean and, by nature of the improved data-hiding, more robust, whilst jMock provides a very neat way to test that code with a minimum of fuss and boiler-plate. </p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em> After ruminating on this for a while I came to the conclusion that JMock is so good at testing "Tell, don't ask" code that I was sure the designers of JMock must have set out with that in mind. I found a very nice post from @natpryce (one of the JMock authors) which confirmed my suspicions - Nat describes tell don't ask very succinctly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"...objects tell each other what to do by sending commands to one another, they don't ask each other for information and then make decisions upon the results of those queries. </p>
  
  <p>The end result of this style is that it is easy to swap one object for another that can respond to the same commands but in a different way. This is because the behaviour of one object is not tied to the internal structure of the objects that it talks to."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nat goes on to say that the only way to test tell-dont-ask code is to see how the state of the world is affected when objects are told to do something (because you can't ask them about their state), and that this is best achieved with mock objects, whereas "train wreck" code (Nat's description of code that is not written tell-dont-ask style, and commonly violates demeter's law) is hard to test with mock objects.</p>

        <title><![CDATA[ElasticSearch vs SOLRCloud]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/elasticsearch_vs_solrcloud.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/elasticsearch_vs_solrcloud.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>For an upcoming work project I need a scalable search platform - scalable to tens or hundreds of millions of documents (news articles), and millions of queries per day. We're a (mostly) Java shop, and have a lot of experience with Lucene, so two solutions that pique my curiosity are SOLRCloud (SOLR + ZooKeeper) and ElasticSearch.</p>

<h3>Initial Impressions - ElasticSearch</h3>

<p>ElasticSearch is impressive. Its clean, simple, and elegant. For those who are familiar with Compass, ElasticSearch can be considered as Compass 3.0 (quoting Shay Bannon, author of Compass). ElasticSearch has been under development for about 9 months at time of writing, and is currently at version 0.15. It appears to be very actively developed, with new features and fixes flowing steadily. </p>

<p>My main worry at this point is that there appears to be only one "resource" active on the project - Shay Bannon (@kimchy) himself, who seems to be architect, developer, documentation-writer, and a prolific commenter on forums.</p>

<h4>Noteworthy features include:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Document-oriented / Schema-free (JSON documents)</li>
<li>Store, retrieve, index and search multiple versions of documents</li>
<li>Self-hosting RESTful web-service api</li>
<li>Exposes the full power of lucene queries</li>
<li>Multiple Indexes in one cluster (described as Multi-Tenancy)</li>
<li>Built from the ground-up with scalability and distributed-operation in mind - supporting distributed search, automatic fail-over and re-balancing, with no single point of failure</li>
<li>Support for async write/backup to shared storage (Gateway, in ElasticSearch parlance)</li>
<li>"Percolator" (aka. prospective search)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initial Impressions - SOLRCloud</h3>

<p>SOLR is a project from the same (Apache) stable as Lucene itself, and the projects have recently merged to some degree. SOLRCloud is an extension that integrates ZooKeeper with SOLR with the express aim of "enabling and simplifying the creation and use of Solr clusters."</p>

<p>SOLRCloud is described as "still under development", ie., not yet a GA release. </p>

<h4>Currently proclaimed features include:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Central configuration of the entire cluster</li>
<li>Automatic load-balancing and fail-over for queries</li>
<li>ZooKeeper integration for cluster coordination and configuration (not sure I would have listed that as a feature personally!)</li>
<li>I'll add that SOLRCloud is part of the SOLR code-base, and is being developed by core Lucene and SOLR committers including Mark Miller and Yonik Seeley. This can only be a good thing :). On top of all that, SOLR has been around for a good long time now, so it is battle-tested and there's lots of information available (including numerous books).</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, I still have two big worries about SOLRCloud:
* Setup/deployment just sounds fiddly - it is recommended not to deploy zookeeper embedded with SOLR (though I cannot find any explanation to back up that recommendation), which means you need both a ZooKeeper ensemble - multiple ZooKeeper instances - and a SOLRCloud ... er ... cloud.
* No GA release as yet, and no roadmap that I can find (this is the closest I got).</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>My next steps are to dive in to both technologies and really get to see which best suits our needs, and really how difficult these things are likely to be to manage in a medium/large-scale deployment.</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Progressive Enhancement with GWT, part 3]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_3.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_3.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE: Since writing this series I have published the source of <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_progressive.html"><code>gwt.progressive</code> at github</a>.</p>

<p>This is the third part in a series, following my thoughts on using GWT in SEO'able web applications. The other parts in the series are <a href="progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_1.html">part 1</a> and <a href="progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_2.html">part 2</a>.</p>

<p>In my previous posts I described an idea for progressive enhancement using GWT -  "activating" server-generated html, to combine GWT goodness with an SEO friendly server-generated website, and my findings after some initial trials. </p>

<p>One of the problems I described in that second post was that it would be very difficult to work with these widgets if nested widgets could not be automatically (or at least easily) bound to fields within this widget.</p>

<p>After a little playing around and learning about GWT Generators I now have what seems like a nice solution, using a Generator to do almost all of the donkey work. Think of it like UiBinder, but with the templates provided at runtime (courtesy of the server). Here's an example class that automatically binds sub-widgets - an Image in this case - to a field of that class:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyWidget extends Widget {

    interface MyActivator extends ElementActivator&lt;MyWidget&gt; {}
    private static MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyActivator.class);

    @RuntimeUiField(tag="img", cssClass="small") Image small;

    public MyWidget(Element anElement) {
        // this will set our element and bind our image field.
        setElement(activator.activate(this, anElement));

        // now we can play with our fields.
        small.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {
            public void onClick(ClickEvent aEvent) {
                Window.alert("clicked!");
            }
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This class will bind onto any html that has an image tag somewhere in its inner-html, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- Say our MyWidget is bound here --&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
          &lt;!-- will be bound to our Image widget --&gt;
      &lt;img class="small" src="/images/image.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone familiar with UiBinder will recognize the pattern I've used for the "activator":</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend an interface with no methods
<code>interface MyActivator extends ElementActivator&lt;MyWidget&gt; {}</code></li>
<li>GWT.create() an instance of that interface
<code>private static MyActivator activator = GWT.create(MyActivator.class);</code></li>
<li>Then use it to initialize your widget
<code>setElement(activator.activate(this, anElement));</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The nice thing about this is we can automatically bind as many widgets as we like onto various sites within the inner-html of our current widget's element. It doesn't mess with the structure (unless you explicitly do so after the binding is done for you), and you can have as much other html within the elements as you like - it will just be left alone, which gives your designers the flexibility to change the layout quite a lot without necessarily needing to re-compile your GWT code. </p>

<p>Currently I have my generator set up to allow your widgets to bind to a choice of tag-name or css-class or both, for example:</p>

<pre><code>// bind to the first &amp;lt;div&gt; found by breadth-first 
// search of child elements
@RuntimeUiField(tag="div") Label label;

// bind to first element with class="my-widget" 
// found by breadth-first search
@RuntimeUiField(cssClass="my-widget") Label label;

// bind to first &amp;lt;div&gt; with class="my-widget" 
// found by breadth-first search
@RuntimeUiField(tag="div", cssClass="my-widget") Label label;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in my examples so far I'm binding standard GWT widgets onto the nested elements. This works for the elements I've used in these examples because they all have a <code>public static Type wrap(Element anElement)</code> method which allows those widgets to be bound onto elements that are already attached to the DOM.</p>

<p>It is also possible to bind widgets of your own making in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a wrap method like 
<code>public static MyWidget wrap(Element anElement)</code></li>
<li>Create a single-argument public Constructor that accepts an <code>Element</code> as its argument.</li>
</ol>

<p>Activate-able widgets can be nested within other such widgets - with no limits that I am aware of so far - and it is also possible to assign nested widgets to a List field in the enclosing widget, like this:</p>

<pre><code>@RuntimeUiField(tag="img") List&lt;Image&gt; images;
</code></pre>

<p>This will search recursively for any <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags inside the enclosing widget's element and bind them all to Image widget's that will be added to the List. The current limitations here are that the List must be declared either as List or ArrayList, and parameterized with a concrete type that meets the criteria defined above (i.e. has a static <code>wrap(Element)</code> method, or a single-arg constructor that takes an <code>Element</code> as the argument).</p>

<p>A remaining question is how to bind the outer-most Widget. Currently I'm doing that using the DOM scanning code I wrote during earlier experiments and which I'm also using in the automatic scanning process set up by the Generator. For example to find the outer-most widgets and kick off the binding process I have something like this in my EntryPoint:</p>

<pre><code>public void onModuleLoad() {
    List&lt;MyWidget&gt; _myWidgets = new ArrayList&lt;mywidget&gt;();
    for (Element _e : Elements.getByCssClass("outer-most-widget")) {
        new MyWidget(_e);
    }
    // do stuff with our widgets ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think of this as very similar to the RootPanel situation - "normal" GWT apps kick off by getting a RootPanel(body tag) or RootPanel's (looked up by id), to which everything else is added. It would be nice to hide away some of that scanning code inside a "top-level" widget - much like RootPanel does for the normal case. I can imagine this might look something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void onModuleLoad() {
    Page _page = Page.activate();
    _page.doStuffWithWidgets();
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I still have lots of things to figure out and questions to answer, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the performance like when binding many hundreds of widgets?</li>
<li>How will this really work when I make ajax requests for more data? (should I make ajax requests for html snippets which I add to the DOM and then bind onto, or switch to json for ajax requests and make my widgets able to replicate themselves from an initial html template?)</li>
<li>What's the best way to divide labour between developers and designers, and for them to organize their interaction? (Ideally I'd like there to be something of a cycle between them, where the designer can rough-out a page design, agree the componentisation with the developer, the developer knocks out some components and a build which the designer can use to activate their static designs, add fidelity, work on other pages with the same components, etc).</li>
<li>Where is the sweet-spot between creating high-fidelity html server-side and decorating it client-side using GWT? Should the GWT components really be just for adding dynamism, or is it a good idea to use them to build additional html sweetness? - I mean the server could dish out html that is more of a model than a view (just enough "view" to satisfy SEO), and the GWT layer acts as a client-side controller and view (<a href="http://www.thinserverarchitecture.com/home">SOFEA/TSA</a> with a nod to SEO).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll try to keep posting as I work things out.</p>

<p>This probably belongs in a separate post, but with reference to that last point on TSA (Thin Server Architecture) - the working group list the following points to define the concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Do not use server-side templating to create the web page.</li>
  <li>Use a classical and simple client-server model, where the client runs in the browser.</li>
  <li>Separate concerns using protocol between client and server and get a much more efficient and less costly development model.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm right behind them on (2) and (3), and also on (1) for "enterprise" apps where SEO is a non-goal. However, for an app that needs SEO, (1) is a deal-breaker, so I'd offer this alternative 1st rule instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use server-side templating to produce a model for the client to consume which minimally satisfies the needs of SEO.</li>
</ol>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE: Since writing this series I have published the source of <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_progressive.html"><code>gwt.progressive</code> at github</a>.</p>

<p>This is the second part in a series, following my thoughts on using GWT in SEO'able web applications. The other parts in the series are <a href="progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_1.html">part 1</a> and <a href="progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_3.html">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Since my earlier post, I spent a little time (only a few hours really, so far) trying a few things out. Here's a smattering of things I learned...</p>

<p>Scanning for elements and binding widgets onto them is easy. Making those widgets behave just like widgets in any normal GWT app needs a little more work.</p>

<h3>Who's the daddy?</h3>

<p>One big problem to get around is that normally GWT widgets are attached via a hierarchy of other widgets (parents) leading back to the RootPanel, whereas when you bind onto some arbitrary element that is already on the page you don't get this hierarchy for free.</p>

<p>When widgets are added to a parent widget some magic happens to set up things like the eventing system. Without that magic you can add as much event-handling plumbing as you like, but it won't work because your widget isn't wired into the eventing system.</p>

<p>Actually getting around this is not all that difficult. Simply invoking onAttach() will wire up your widget, though its a little unpleasant to have to do that.</p>

<p>Another problem with the lack of hierarchy is, well, there's no hierarchy. Things that you would normally do in GWT widgets - like adding, removing or replacing child widgets - gets a little trickier. If you want to use the technique recursively (and why wouldn't you?), you need to allow widgets to bind to elements inside other widgets without causing them to be removed from and re-attached to the DOM, but crucially you still need to add them as 'logical' children of the parent widget, otherwise the parent knows nothing about the child widgets and can't do any of those "normal" operations with them.</p>

<p>To do that there are two problems to overcome:</p>

<ol>
<li>The parent needs to have the children added to it, so that the set of child widgets is known and available for manipulation (say by extending ComplexPanel and using the getChildren() method).</li>
<li>Some of the child widgets might need hard, typed references in the parent widget to allow direct manipulation of the child widget - just like in a "normal" GWT widget you would keep a reference to the Button you added in the constructor in order that you can bind ClickHandler's to it or toggle its enabled-ness.</li>
</ol>

<p>Point 1 is easily solved - any widget that wants to play this way needs to support adding other widgets without triggering an attachment to the current element. When you add a normal child widget to a normal  parent widget, the child is detached from its current parent - logically and physically - so that its html element is actually inserted into the DOM under the parent's element. This is not what we want when binding onto a template - we just want the logical attachment step, so we need to support an add method something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void logicalAdd(Widget aWidget) {
  getChildren().add(aWidget);
  adopt(aWidget);     
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've yet to try to solve point 2. So far I've built:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tools to help with scanning for elements to bind to, and then binding the right widget.</li>
<li>Plumbing to allow recursively binding widgets with logical hierarchy intact (point 1 above).</li>
<li>An example that binds widgets recursively - an outer container, an inner container, and a bunch of widgets inside that are manipulated by the inner container.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll try to update the post with an example at some point. Meanwhile my next challenge is to solve point 2 such that widget developers can build their widgets in a fairly typical GWT way.</p>

<p>As an aside, I lay awake for a while last night pondering the ability to give designers a client-side templating system, where they can write the html for a component once (declaring it to be a template, which may include recursive binding points for GWT-activated widgets) and then re-use it elsewhere within their html by reference to the template. I'm sure this would be possible, though its utility might extend only to mock-ups.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the first part in a series, following my thoughts on using GWT in SEO'able web applications. The other parts in the series are <a href="progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="progressive_enhancement_with_gwt_part_3.html">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>GWT Is a superb framework for developing complex, componentized html &amp; javascript widgets.  You can have your cake and eat it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop down into native javascript as and when you feel the need</li>
<li>Integrate easily with native js components and libraries</li>
<li>Use GWT components relatively easily from native javascript</li>
<li>Create super-condensed, fast, platform-specific code, easily</li>
<li>All the benefits of Java's static type-system, packages, and tooling to manage and refactor your code</li>
<li>It is very tempting to go for an all-out GWT user-interface, which is great if what you want is a super-snazzy Rich-Internet-Application which packs down into very small and extremely cacheable js bundles that fetch data asynchronously from the server, and you don't mind re-compiling your user-interface to make even a very small change.</li>
</ul>

<p>It isn't so great when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to expose the content of your site for search-engines to index (The SEO Problem).</li>
<li>You want to leverage the html and css skills of your UI designers, and to be able to generate more flexible layouts without requiring a re-compile (The Design Problem).</li>
</ul>

<h2>The SEO Problem</h2>

<p>To a search engine, GWT apps just look like a big fat lump of dense javascript. Nothing to see here, move along. Its a similar problem for any web-app that uses ajax to collect data from the server, but the problem is magnified with GWT due to the fact that the entire application tends to present as a large lump of dense javascript, whereas many other ajax technologies typically involve some amount of server-side content rendering that can make the site at least partially visible to crawlers.</p>

<p>Google have a recommendation for how to get around the problems of SEO for ajax applications, which entails a special url form and the creation of "html snapshots" - effectively a parallel, ajax-disabled site that the crawler can index. This seems to me to be a workable but irritating solution that involves doing a lot of extra work just to allow a search engine to crawl the site. Its effectively just a Google-approved cloaking method. Also it isn't clear to me whether any other search engines than Google support this approach.</p>

<h2>The Design Problem</h2>

<p>Don't get me wrong, its not as bad as all that. You can, of course, leverage your UI/UX designer's talents when building GWT apps. They can produce designs that the GWT developers base their components on, and with UIBinder the html fragments produced by a designer can be used in large chunks, but there is always some disconnect between what the designers produce and what is actually output by the application - usually because there is a developer translating the designer's work into GWT components.</p>

<p>In retrospect, having built a number of "monolithic" GWT applications, it seems to me that what we're missing is a way to step back just a little from the "GWT does everything" mind-set, and instead to leverage GWT where it is best suited, and something a little more flexible where GWT can be too restrictive - for example when laying out high level components on a page it would be advantageous to be able to escape from the restrictions of having to compile that page layout into js, and instead work at the level of straight-forward declarative markup.</p>

<h2>Introducing "GWT-Activated Pages"</h2>

<p>How can we solve these two issues? One idea I've been toying with, is to use GWT for progressive enhancement of simple html + css, and goes as follows:</p>

<p>Rather than try to build two almost parallel versions of your application (one for SEO, one for real users), why not build one with a layered approach that allows graceful degradation for browsers with javascript disabled (of which search-engines could be considered a sub-set).</p>

<p>The base-layer that non-javascript browsers would render, and which search-engines would see, would be generated  by some typical server-side technology - php, jsp, struts, jfaces, ... take your pick. This would build a "wireframe" of your page, giving it a basic shape and layout, and filling in some starter content. The markup would ideally be meaningful, in the sense that headings would appear in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags to indicate that they are headings, rather than to give them any particular styling.</p>

<p>This base layer would be something that designers could work on directly, including any and all css styling.</p>

<p>The second layer would be a set of GWT widgets that "activate" or progressively enhance the page, by scanning the DOM for certain signs that denote activateable sections of markup. When the base page loads, GWT widgets search for elements to bind themselves to. When a widget finds such an element it binds to it and "activates" it. Activation could mean anything from completely changing the html markup, to binding event-listeners, to handling interaction with ajax data loading from the server.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example "base" layer:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Page Header&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="gwt-navigation-widget"&gt;
      &lt;!-- the listitems are generated server side --&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=".."&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=".."&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=".."&gt;Videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=".."&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=".."&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;ol class="gwt-news-ticker-widget"&gt;
      &lt;!-- the listitems are generated server side --&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;News story 1&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;News story 2&lt;/li&gt;
      ...
      &lt;!-- this last listitem gives a link that 
               a search engine can follow to get more data --&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=".."&gt;older stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;


    &lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" 
                src="widgets/navigation-widget.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" 
                src="widgets/news-ticker-widget.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the elements with css class-names prefixed with "gwt-". These are the signs that our gwt widgets will be looking for in order to know which elements they should activate.</p>

<p>As you probably guessed, the navigation widget would detect any elements with a class-name matching "gwt-navigation-widget", while the news-ticker will search for "gwt-news-ticker-widget".</p>

<p>OK, so what do we get for our troubles? Well, several things potentially:</p>

<ul>
<li>One request to the server to get our initial page full of data (rather than multiple widgets requesting async loading of little chunks of data)</li>
<li>A page that contains the data and is search-engine friendly, allowing pages deep within your app to indexed by search-engines</li>
<li>A very clear separation of widgets and page layout, allowing you more flexibility to change the page layout without GWT re-compile</li>
<li>Flexibility in dividing work between designers and developers:
<ul><li>designers can focus on the design-heavy html and css work, and the overall page layout</li>
<li>developers can focus on interaction with the server, complex widget behaviour, etc.</li></ul></li>
<li>Upon finding an element to bind to, the widget would:
<ul><li>Examine the content of the element - this will very likely be the source of its initial configuration and/or data-set, and also might include some information about how to load more content, as in the news-ticker example whose last <li> is a link to "older stories". I'm sure it would be a good idea to make this even more explicit, but like I said this is supposed to be a simple example :)</li>
<li>Replace or modify the content of the element - perhaps the widget displays a very complicated UI, so it removes the html and replaces it with something nifty that it generates, or maybe it just adds some decoration in the form of small visible changes, or perhaps it binds a bunch of event handlers to do neat tricks like adding gesture handling for touch-screen users. It seems that it would be perfectly possible to bind widgets inside widgets in this way, although at some point you would probably want to control the binding order such that an outer widget binds before an inner one. One way to do this might be to have a page-activator that seeks elements that want to be activated, and which all widgets are registered with. This could be described nicely as a Pattern.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In my simple example I showed the scripts being loaded separately, just for clarity, but I'm sure you wouldn't want to load each widget as a separate script - that would lose a good chunk of GWT's advantage. Rather, the whole widget-set could be loaded as one script, cached forever, and used all over.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to see an example of GWT-activated pages at work, just take a look at my older post on <a href="3d_graphics_using_the_html5_canvas.html">rendering 3D Rubiks Cubes with GWT and HTML5 Canvas</a>, where the rubik's cubes are rendered by a gwt widget that "activates" a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element containing the configuration for the cube.</p>

<p>OK, but what are the down-sides? Here's a few...</p>

<ul>
<li>Compiler no longer has visibility across the whole UI.</li>
<li>Messaging between components becomes more difficult (but not impossible). This has its advantages too - it forces low coupling. Messaging via OpenAjax Hub or similar would be worth considering.</li>
<li>It's more work - in some naive ways - than a straight-out GWT UI, and many would argue why bother to use GWT at all if you need SEO (depends on your skill-set and the complexity of the components you're building in my view).</li>
<li>I'm sure that there are others which I'm currently blind to ... I need to try to build some more complex and interesting examples to find these out.</li>
</ul>

<p>tl;dr ?</p>

I'm particularly intrigued to read "The Art of Scalability" - I've never come across a book quite like this that addresses the organisational aspects of scaling a company and processes alongside the architectural aspects of developing scalable software.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Interesting to see how Ubuntu has overtaken its sire Debian in recent years - Google Trends really is amazing.</p>

<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hG-kje6-TJM/TSIqrAJk8gI/AAAAAAAAG_g/e1VdMyp4pJ4/s1600/ubuntu-vs-debian.png" alt="Google Trends chart of Ubuntu (blue), Debian (red), CentOS (green) and Suse (orange)." /></p>

<p><code>Ubuntu (blue), Debian (red), CentOS (green) and Suse (orange)</code></p>

<p>Here's the link to see the full <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=ubuntu,+debian,+centos,+suse&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">google-trends page</a> for this comparison.</p>

<p>I love the spikes on the ubuntu line every 6 months - I imagine these coincide with the 6-monthly .4 and .10 releases (April and October).</p>

<p>Interestingly, when I compare Ubuntu with Windows 7 and OSX, OSX loses out strongly to Ubuntu (perhaps I'm using the wrong term, but I tried a number of different combinations), while Win7 is around 3x more popular than Ubuntu.  Also interesting to note how OSX beats Ubuntu in the "news" mentions (below the x-axis) presumably because of the Apple PR machine:</p>

        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/3d_graphics_using_the_html5_canvas.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/3d_graphics_using_the_html5_canvas.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I thought i'd put up a quick sample of my latest play-thing - a 3D rendering of a rubik's cube, using javascript (GWT) to implement the z-buffer and the html5 canvas as the display.  I originally built this in plain old javascript, but have now converted it to GWT - partly just for fun and partly to make the code a bit more manageable and refactorable (if that's even a word). Along the way I made a few optimisations like caching radian, sin and cosine values of angles.</p>

<p>The cube is made from 27 "blocks", each of which has a face in each of the rubik-cube face colours. When the 27 blocks are put together we get the completed cube. Admittedly the 27th block isn't really necessary (its right in the middle where it is never visible), but it made life just that little bit simpler to ignore that and go with it.</p>

<p>The cubes you can see below are rendered when the page loads. The scenes are pretty simple, so render very quickly. You may have seen the cube configuration instead of the cubes for a short while until the javascript loaded, at which point the configuration is replaced by the rendered cubes.</p>

<p>Configuring a cube to display is done <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_progressive.html">progressive enhancement</a> style -  simply by adding a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="rubiks" style="width:150px; height:150px;"&gt;
  {"rubik-cube":{}, "camera":{}}}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This sets up the default position and orientation for both camera and cube, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="rubiks" style="height: 150px; width: 150px; margin:auto;">{"rubik-cube":{}, "camera":{}}</div>

<p>That's a pretty boring view, so lets rotate the cube so that we can see more than just the red-face nearest us. To do that we supply some rotations around the x and y axis like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="rubiks" style="width:150px; height:150px;"&gt;
  { 
    "rubik-cube":{ 
      "rotate-x":35, 
      "rotate-y":35, 
      "rotate-z":35 
    }, 
    "camera":{}
  }
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following cube:</p>

<div class="rubiks" style="height: 150px; width: 150px; margin:auto;">{ "rubik-cube": { "rotate-x":35, "rotate-y":35, "rotate-z":35 }, "camera":{} }</div>

<p>I'm quite pleased with the results so far, and the performance is not bad either it seems. The speed of actually drawing on the canvas seems to be plenty good enough to get away with a bit of animation. On my (Core i7) laptop I can spin the cube on all 3 axis at a couple-hundred frames per second (hopefully i'll put up an example in a later post). </p>

<p>Next steps for the rubik's application (yeah, like i'll get around to it) would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supply "twist" information in the configuration so I can show cubes in various stages of completion.</li>
<li>Animate the twists, allowing a viewer to step through the twists, for example to see how to solve a particular part of a cube.</li>
<li>Interactive mode where the viewer can play with the cube.</li>
<li>In a separate direction, the z-buffer i've built up in order to render the cubes could be improved in lots of nice ways too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just before I finish off with a few more views of the cube, I wanted to mention that I had a few issues finding a way to host the scripts and use them in Blogger. Annoyingly you can't host javascript or html files directly from Blogger, so I had to find somewhere else to put them.</p>

<p>My usual approach for hosting source code is to use github "gists", which provides a neat way of showing prettified source, but also lets you view the "raw" source. That allowed me to host the js somewhere, but I had to work around a cross-site scripting issue loading the GWT sources from a different domain. </p>

<p>Fortunately GWT makes that easy with its "xs" linker, which produces a bunch of ".no-cache.js" files instead of "no-cache.html" files, and solves the XSS problem. To use the xs linker you just add a single line to your .gwt.xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;add-linker name="xs" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Sadly that prevents hosted mode from working (currently), but that's easy enough to work around :)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I was watching a David Attenborough program the other day on the origins of life on Earth. He visited a place in Morocco where some enterprising locals are grinding down a mountain of sandstone looking for trilobyte fossils which they clean up and sell, in some cases for thousands of dollars. These fossils are pretty small - easily fit in the palm of your hand - but the detail is amazing.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Dug out a couple more old sketches.</p>

<p>I remember sitting at the kitchen table at my old house when I started this first one, which means it pre-dates March 2007 when I moved. Its drawn from a photo I took on a holiday with friends in Scotland in 2004 I think. Contrary to an earlier post my pencils aren't Derwent Studio's (oops), I checked and they are in fact Faber Castell Polychromos, which have a lovely soft feel, on 220gsm A2 (594mm x 420mm) Windsor &amp; Newton heavyweight cartwridge paper.</p>

<p>The whole back-end of the squirrel is missing - can't squeeze enough into my A4 scanner (A4 is 1/4 the size of A2). I attempted to stitch a second scan onto this one to complete the squirrel, but the join is very clear to see, and i just can't summon the energy to wrestle The Gimp into blending the two images together nicely.</p>

<p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hG-kje6-TJM/TQOhuCbs6YI/AAAAAAAAAIk/sx5qWNJqn2w/s640/squirrel-face.jpg" alt="Red squirrel, colour pencil on A2, drawn from photo I took in Scotland in 2004." /></p>

<p>The next one pre-date's the squirrel, but again was drawn at my old house, after my holiday in Mexico (where I took the picture its drawn from). That dates it somewhere between September 2002 and March 2007. My guess is 2004. Again its Faber-Castell colour-pencil on Windsor &amp; Newton A2, scanned by my A4 scanner so the legs (to the right of this section) and the tail (above this section) are cut off here.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you'll want to use a non-standard CSS property in GWT via CSSResource - say to use rounded-corners on your borders using <code>-moz-border-radius</code> and <code>-webkit-border-radius</code>.</p>

<p>However, if you just plonk those properties in your CSSResource you're in for some warnings.  GWT doesn't like property names that start with "-".  The solution is very simple: escape the leading "-" with a "\", e.g. <code>\-moz-border-radius: 5px</code>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I decided it was high time I got a copy of my photos from the last 10 years or so backed-up somewhere. I downloaded Picasa (3.0-beta for ubuntu x64) and signed up for web-albums and started rummaging through my pics.  Picasa tells me I have 5,773 pictures in my ~/Pictures directory, so I could be having to spend rather a long time sorting through that lot!</p>

<p>Scrolling through I came across some old sketches from way back (2002 and older), some of which I had scanned at various stages during the sketch. After a bit of fighting with Picasa (I didn't want it to throw away my original tif files) I got it to pick up the extra converted jpg copies which i made, and tried to upload them ... no go on that score, its still doing incrementally backing-off retries and failing to upload with no explanation. The log file location says "c:\Documents and settings...", which is a bit of a laugh given i'm running ubuntu :)</p>

<p>Instead I uploaded those converted jpg's via the web-albums website, and shared the album. Here's a sample:</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><code>pony sketch, step 1</code></th>
    <th><code>pony sketch, step 2</code></th>
    <th><code>pony sketch, finished</code></th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Honestly no idea why the last one has a blue-ish tint to it - I must have screwed up scanning it or something. I'll balance the colours and re-upload if I get a chance.</p>

<p>This was drawn from a photo I took at Llyn-Brianne in mid Wales, some time around 2002. There was a whole herd of what I can only assume are wild ponies just wandering around up there, and this little guy was one of them.</p>

<p>This sketch is a full side of A4, drawn with Derwent studio colour pencils. I saw someone drawing with these at an art show I went to with my dad years ago, and bought the 72 pack there and then - they really are fantastic.</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Making pretty diagrams with GraphViz]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/making_pretty_diagrams_with_graphviz.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/making_pretty_diagrams_with_graphviz.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>So recently I needed to draw some directed-graph diagrams - work-flow diagrams in this particular instance. After a bit of googling I came across some nice examples of diagrams produced by <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> - actually what really turned me on to graphviz was this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kentbye/sets/72157601523153827/">nice set of examples</a> from Kent Bye.</p>

<p>A little tinkering and I soon had my workflow definitions (declared in xml in our application) rendered nicely with GraphViz. The markup language is deadly simple and intuitive, and the directed graphs which it produces are really good looking (I didn't try any other types).</p>

<p>Lets take a look at some examples, starting simply with two nodes related in one direction only. The markup would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>digraph {
  "Start" -&gt; "End" [];
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it.  No really.  This is all you need to create a simple, two-node directed graph diagram.  To draw the diagram you need to install graphviz (with a quality OS like ubuntu you just need the magic incantation <code>sudo apt-get install graphviz</code> and you're up and running). Once installed invoke graphviz like this:</p>

<pre><code>dot -Tpng -oMyGraph.png MyGraph.dot
</code></pre>

<p>This invokes the directed-graph drawing tool, tells it to produce a png image from the input file <code>MyGraph.dot</code> and store it in the output file <code>MyGraph.png</code>. The resulting diagram looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hG-kje6-TJM/TMXyojkLHhI/AAAAAAAAABc/fNd8MB0KVHQ/s1600/graph1.png" alt="first graphviz diagram" /></p>

<p>Coolness!</p>

<p>Lets get a bit more trick! We can control the size and shape of our nodes, and label the edges:</p>

<pre><code>digraph {
  "A" [shape="circle"];
  "B" [shape="rectangle"];
  "C" [shape="diamond"];

  "A" -&gt; "B" [label="A to B"];
  "B" -&gt; "C" [label="B to C"];
  "A" -&gt; "B" [label="A to C"];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the diagram:</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hG-kje6-TJM/TMX0xR56twI/AAAAAAAAABg/m1Qmknip5hg/s1600/graph2.png" alt="second graphviz diagram" /></p>

<p>Isn't it just too cool? Last one coming up - this time with colours:</p>

<pre><code>digraph {
  "Back" [shape="egg" color="green" style="filled" fillcolor="yellow"];
  "Forth" [shape="house" color="red"];
  "Other" [shape="invtriangle" color="blue"];

  "Back" -&gt; "Forth" [color="orange" label="weee"];
  "Forth" -&gt; "Back" [color="purple" label="eeew"];

  "Other" -&gt; "Forth"
  "Other" -&gt; "Back"
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's how it looks:</p>

<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hG-kje6-TJM/TMX3xBFNcTI/AAAAAAAAABk/YrBxMds9R28/s1600/graph3.png" alt="third graphviz diagram" /></p>

<p>I realize this just scratches the surface - there's a whole bunch of other node shapes you can use, you can define defaults for nodes and edges once at the beginning of your *.dot file, and much much more.</p>

<p>I only discovered GraphViz about 2 months ago, but since I did i've been using it quite a lot. Its very handy for drawing simple representations of work-flows, navigational flows, any kind of hierarchical structures (trees and graphs), etc., and just <em>so simple</em> to write. Generating the <code>*.dot</code> syntax programmatically is extremely easy - I now have our app invoking "dot" to generate the graphs on the fly.</p>

<p>Note: Google Charts now has experimental support for (a subset of) graphviz. Check it out <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/image/docs/gallery/graphviz.html">here</a>.You don't even have to install graphviz :)</p>

<p>I'll leave you with one more example - a visualisation of a subset of a work-flow from a work-flow system I've been building recently for our Editorial System. The work-flow engine we've built is basically a Finite State Machine (FSM), and a work-flow diagram like this is basically a State diagram for the machine. A workflow thus forms a very nice directed graph, making GraphViz ideal for rendering work-flows:</p>

<pre><code>digraph { 

  node [shape=circle,fontsize=8,fixedsize=true,width=0.9]; 
  edge [fontsize=8]; 
  rankdir=LR;

  "low-priority" [shape="doublecircle" color="orange"];
  "high-priority" [shape="doublecircle" color="orange"];

  "s1" -&gt; "low-priority";
  "s2" -&gt; "low-priority";
  "s3" -&gt; "low-priority";

  "low-priority" -&gt; "s4";
  "low-priority" -&gt; "s5";
  "low-priority" -&gt; "high-priority" [label="wait-time exceeded"];

  "high-priority" -&gt; "s4";
  "high-priority" -&gt; "s5";

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the GraphViz output:</p>

        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_widgets_with_html_id_attributes.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/gwt_widgets_with_html_id_attributes.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>It isn't immediately obvious how to get your GWT widgets to produce id attributes that you can use from external scripts or testing tools like WebDriver or Selenium.</p>

<p>To make your widgets produce id attributes you need to invoke the <code>ensureDebugId</code> method with an id string, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Label myLabel = new Label("Say something");
myLabel.ensureDebugId("myLabel");
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you run that you still won't get any id attributes. The clue is in the method name <code>ensureDebugId</code>. You actually need to inherit the <code>Debug</code> module in your module descriptor (<code>.gwt.xml</code>) file.  The module to inherit is: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;inherits name="com.google.gwt.user.Debug"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you view the source of your label you'll see that it has an id attribute, but you might be surprised that it doesn't quite match the id you supplied (<code>myLabel</code>). In fact it will say <code>gwt-debug-myLabel</code>.</p>

        <link><![CDATA[http://steveliles.github.com/testing_gwt_apps_in_dev_mode_with_webdriver.html]]></link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://steveliles.github.com/testing_gwt_apps_in_dev_mode_with_webdriver.html</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I've been playing a little with WebDriver for testing GWT apps.  First impressions:
* WebDriver is awesome - can't wait to try testing more complex web-apps!
* WebDriver opens up all kinds of possibilities beyond testing web-apps - for example to drive interactive demos and tutorials.
* Did I mention WebDriver is awesome? :)</p>

<h2>Preparing the Eclipse project</h2>

<p>To get started I made a new toy project to play in. I don't use the Google Eclipse plugins for GWT dev - if you do you could create this project using the wizards instead. I develop in Eclipse, but always set up my projects with Maven, so the first step for me was to create a new maven project:</p>

<pre><code>mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=com.sjl -DartifactId=webdriver
</code></pre>

<p>Next, create the Eclipse project so I can use eclipse to edit the maven pom...</p>

<pre><code>mvn eclipse:eclipse
</code></pre>

<p>And then edit <code>pom.xml</code> in Eclipse to add the GWT, JUnit4 and WebDriver dependencies (by default maven adds JUnit 3.8, so I replace that with JUnit 4.4).</p>

<p>To add the GWT dependencies you also need a repository that actually has them - I use the CodeHaus gwt maven plugins during the build step, which also exposes the CodeHaus repository for fetching the dependences:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;pluginRepositories&gt;
    &lt;pluginRepository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;codehaus-snapshots&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Codehaus plugin snapshot repository&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/pluginRepository&gt;
  &lt;/pluginRepositories&gt; 
  ...
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
   &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.gwt&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;gwt-dev&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.0.4&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;optional&gt;true&lt;/optional&gt;
   &lt;/dependency&gt;
   &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.gwt&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;gwt-user&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.0.4&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
   &lt;/dependency&gt;
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Next the WebDriver dependencies - I got these as transitive dependencies of selenium2:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;dependency&gt;
     &lt;groupId&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupId&gt;
     &lt;artifactId&gt;selenium&lt;/artifactId&gt;
     &lt;version&gt;2.0a4&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Having edited the <code>pom.xml</code> file you need to rebuild the eclipse project using the eclipse maven plugin:</p>

<pre><code>mvn eclipse:eclipse
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a little while to download the dependencies if you don't already have them - the gwt dependencies in particular are quite large.  Once the command completes you need to refresh the project in Eclipse for it to reload the project classpath.</p>

<h2>Creating a simple GWT app</h2>

<p>I made a really simple application to play with, consisting of just an EntryPoint that displays a Label, and a PushButton which adds more Label's when clicked.  I had just a handful of aims in mind for this first attempt:
1. Get a GWT app to load via WebDriver
2. Find an element which GWT has created (the first Label)
3. Interact with an element that does something (the PushButton)
4. Check that the something actually happened and that we can test for it.</p>

<p>The GWT code for this is extremely simple:</p>

<pre><code>package com.sjl.webdriver.client;

import com.google.gwt.core.client.*;
import com.google.gwt.event.dom.client.*;
import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.*;

public class SimpleApp implements EntryPoint {

  public void onModuleLoad() {
    final RootPanel _root = RootPanel.get();
    _root.add(new Label("Hello"));
    _root.add(newButton());
  }

  private PushButton newButton() {
    PushButton _b = new PushButton("push me");
    _b.ensureDebugId("button");

    _b.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler(){
    public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
    _root.add(new Label("whoop"));
      }
    });

    return _b;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pushing the button adds a new Label for each push - something we should be able to detect pretty easily.</p>

<p>My gwt module file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;module rename-to="webdriver"&gt;  
  &lt;inherits name="com.google.gwt.user.User"/&gt;
  &lt;inherits name="com.google.gwt.user.Debug"/&gt;
  &lt;entry-point class="com.sjl.webdriver.client.SimpleApp" /&gt;  
 &lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next I made an <code>ApplicationDriver</code> class to wrap up the details of getting WebDriver to interact with the web app and let our tests deal with the web app in terms of a ubiquitous domain language - overkill for this simple example i'm sure, but if you want to write expressive tests for a complex web app you really need to do so at a higher level than WebDriver invocations. </p>

<p>The <code>ApplicationDriver</code> class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>package com.sjl.webdriver;

import java.util.*;
import org.openqa.selenium.*;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.*;

public class ApplicationDriver {

  private WebDriver driver;

  public ApplicationDriver() {
    System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.profile", "default");
    driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    driver.get(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html?" + 
    "gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997"); 
  }

  public void pushTheButton() { 
    WebElement _element = driver.findElement(
    By.id("gwt-debug-button"));
    _element.click();
  }

  public int countLabels() {
    List&lt;WebElement&gt; _elements = driver.findElements(
    By.className("gwt-Label"));
    return _elements.size();
  }

  public void quit() {
    driver.close();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now there are a few things worth noting here, as it took me a while to arrive at this point with something that actually worked.</p>

<p>First of all, notice that i'm using the <code>FirefoxDriver</code> implementation. I had started out with <code>HtmlUnitDriver</code> which works just fine for testing a compiled GWT app (provided you create it with javascript support - <code>new HtmlUnitDriver(true)</code> - and ignore the warnings about x-javascript) but I wanted to test during development by running OOPHM. </p>

<p>Stupidly I was trying to get this to work with the <code>HtmlUnitDriver</code> for a while, til I had a Homer Simpson moment (doh!) and realized that of course <code>HtmlUnitDriver</code> can't work - it doesn't have a GWT plugin :).</p>

<p>Secondly, the <code>FirefoxDriver</code> implementation starts up an instance of Firefox with a profile called "WebDriver". If you don't have a profile with that name Firefox will create one when it starts, but it won't have any of your plugins (including the GWT plugin!). </p>

<h3>Creating a Firefox profile for WebDriver</h3>

<p>Its easy to create a new profile (close all instances of firefox down completely then run it from the cmdline with the -profilemanager switch) - <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_manager">precise instructions vary by platform</a>. I created the profile then just copied my existing profile contents to it to save installing all the plugins again. In the sample code above i've told WebDriver to use the "default" profile instead by setting a system property.</p>

<p>Finally, note that I'm finding the <code>PushButton</code> by id lookup. To make this work you have to force GWT to spit out an id for the element, and allow for the fact that GWT adds a prefix ("gwt-debug-") to the id you specify. To force GWT to produce id's for your Widget elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inherit the Debug module in your module descriptor file (.gwt.xml)</li>
<li>Set an id on the Widget using widget.ensureDebugId("theId");</li>
</ul>

<p>Last of all I built the testcase on top of the <code>ApplicationDriver</code>, starting with a test to detect the first Label, then a test to click the PushButton and check that a new Label is added.  The testcase looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>package com.sjl.webdriver;

import static junit.framework.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class TestSimpleApp {

  private ApplicationDriver driver;

  @Before
  public void openBrowser() {
    driver = new ApplicationDriver();
  }

  @After
  public void closeBrowser() {
    driver.quit();
  }

  @Test
  public void canDetectALabel() {
    assertEquals(1, driver.countLabels());
  }

  @Test
  public void pushingTheButtonAddsALabel() {
    assertEquals(1, driver.countLabels());
    driver.pushTheButton();
    assertEquals(2, driver.countLabels());
  }

  @Test
  public void pushingTheButtonAgainAddsAnotherLabel() {
    assertEquals(1, driver.countLabels());
    driver.pushTheButton();
    assertEquals(2, driver.countLabels());
    driver.pushTheButton();
    assertEquals(3, driver.countLabels());
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it ... start up GWT OOPHM, run the Junit testcase, and marvel as Firefox starts up, runs the app, and shuts down again (3 times - once for each test), leaving you with a nice green bar in JUnit. I'm sure that restarting firefox between each test would be a bad idea - slooooow - in practice, I just wanted to try it to see that it worked :)</p>

<p>The next interesting test to play with will be testing asynchronous activity like AJAX requests.  I'm hoping there'll be some nice Patterns described by the WebDriver community for writing such tests.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>While performance testing some mysql queries in ubuntu I came across the old problem that even after restarting mysql to clear its own buffers, the OS caches speed up consecutive runs of the same query. In order to get consistent results you need to flush both the mysql buffers and the native OS buffers.</p>

<p>Flushing the mysql buffers is as easy as restarting mysql (<code>sudo service mysql restart</code> in Maverick). Flushing the OS buffers is also dead easy:</p>

<pre><code>sudo sh -c "sync; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
</code></pre>

<p>I have system-monitor gauges on my taskbar showing cpu, memory and disk activity, and its a beautiful thing to see the cache suddenly get wiped :)</p>
